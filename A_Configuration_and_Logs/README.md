## Configuration and Logs

This directory contains all the configuration files. Settings for the program should be made in the file
"config.ini". The settings there will affect the attributes of the class "ConfLog" in conf_and_log.py.
All logs are written to "error.log"

The settings in the "config.ini" file are commented if necessary but in general should be self-explaining.
