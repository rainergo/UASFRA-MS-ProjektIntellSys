We have used emission factors from UK Government Conversion Factors and   IEA for international sites. •  Methodology: An operational control approach has been used for the organisational boundary. This is the same as last year 2019/20. •  Additional inclusions: We have included the emissions from our stand-alone vet practices and referral centres. The impact of these is de minimis. •  Exclusions: Only anaesthetics sourced from preferred Pets at Home suppliers has been included in the calculation. •  Exclusions: A small number of train and air journeys were not reported, as no carbon intensity data was available, this is de minimis. •  Estimation: Where this year’s data was not available 1.8% of sites used last year’s consumption data. •  Independent verification: Our 2020/21 Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions are verified to a limited level of assurance by Ernst and Young LLP using the ISAE3000(revised) and ISAE3410 standards, Please refer to page 52 of the  social value report for their assurance statement. •  Normalisation: We have chosen to report gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions tonnes of CO2e per £m revenue as this is a common metric used in corporate greenhouse gas reporting. •  Market-based criteria: Since October 2017 we have procured 100% renewable electricity backed by REGOs and assessed for conformance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Quality Criteria. An emission factor of zero  has therefore been applied since that date to calculate our Scope 2 market-based figure, whilst a location-based factor was used to calculate Scope 3 emissions from transmission and distribution losses.   A small amount of electricity has been purchased outside of the Group renewable energy contract and this is included in the market based calculation. •  Carbon mitigation: Pets at Home Ltd is donating £65,000 to the Woodland Trust (a company limited by guarantee (Company Number: 1982873 and a registered charity, Charity Number England and Wales: No.  294344, Scotland No. SC038885 whose registered office is at Kempton Way, Grantham, Lincolnshire NG31 6LL) to absorb 2,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide (equivalent to our use of fugitive gas, natural gas in our buildings  and electricity procured outside of the Group renewable contract), through the planting of 11,093 trees, helping with our strategy to reduce our business carbon footprint. •  UK proportions: Pets at Home operations are UK based except for a small office in Hong Kong. Therefore less than 0.1% of total scope 1 and 2 emissions and kWh usage was from outside of the UK.'}},\n {'page_number': 88,\n  'short_text_and_number': set(),\n  'text_for_word2vec': {'  • This year we have committed that by 2030 we will achieve net-zero emissions  operationally (scope 1 & 2) and by 2040 achieve net-zero emissions across our  value chain (scope 3), using a science based initiative approved methodology'},\n  'table_values': set()}]"
