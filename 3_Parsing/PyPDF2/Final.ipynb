These APMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to statutory measures. For more information on APMs, see the APM Glossary.2 Constant currency percentage movements are calculated by restating the results for the year ended 30 June 2021 at the average exchange rates applied to adjusted operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2020.3 The Group has changed its accounting policy related to the capitalisation of certain software assets following the IFRIC Interpretation Committee’s agenda decision published in April 2021. This change in accounting policy led to an increase in operating expenses of £2.7m in the current year and £5.2m for FY20. All FY20 results  are restated and for details of the full impact see Note 2 Basis of Preparation. Profit before tax excluding SaaS impact is presented only this  year to demonstrate the impact of our change  in accounting policy, and will not be presented  in future periods.4 The primary intensity ratio is a measure of the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions per tonne of animal weight.\f03STRATEGIC REPORT0.055.82021202020192018201746.34.05.640.755.80.084.82021202020192018201765.855.156.356.484.80.037.52021202020192018201735.210.024.325.437.50322021202020192018201729.127.726.023.632.0STRONG CASH GENERATION, EARNINGS MOMENTUM AND INCREASED DIVIDEND >Strong free cash flow 1 of £37.5m, net debt 1 of £105.6m, net debt to EBITDA 1 ratio remains strong at 0.9x >Adjusted earnings per share 1 up 40% in constant currency2 >Recommended final dividend up 10% with 3.2x adjusted earnings cover 1SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC PROGRESS  >Continued to win new customers globally, due to our leading porcine and bovine genetics; genetic improvements contributing to the reduction in use of energy, water and land in animal protein production >PIC China continues to win customers; five new key accounts  in FY21; serving over one third of top Chinese producers >Continued shift in ABS’s product mix; 23% of global sales volume comprising sexed genetics and embryos reflecting Sexcel’s® continued success and 29% beef genetics reflecting the growing use of NuEra beef genetics in dairy herds >Acquisition in Spain of Sergal (total consideration £7.7m)expands supply chain and sireline market share in the world’s fourth largest pig market  >GenusOne enterprise system successful roll-out continues, with North America completed and Spain now live >Significant capex investment underway, to support expansion of best -in -industry facilities for PIC and ABS >Good progress with carbon reduction with the primary intensity ratio4 reduced by 11% cumulative compared with  FY19 baseline BUILDING R&D CAPABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITY PIPELINE >Good progress with the Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome virus (‘PRRSv’) resistance development programme, with two successful disease trials and a defined path to regulatory approval >Next generation of IntelliGen, Gen2 (‘Gen2’) sexing technology launched; more compact, effective and efficient than the previous generation technology >Rapidly built world class reproductive biology team  and secured strategic partnerships with leading  external collaborators >Strategic minority investment in Xelect (£2.4m), a genetic improvement consultancy in the fast-growing aqua  genetics marketSTATUTORY PROFIT BEFORE TAX 3£55.8mFREE CASH FLOW 1£37.5mADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX 1, 3£84.8mDIVIDEND PER SHARE32.0p\fFY13Research & Development2Capital Expenditure3Acquisitions & InvestmentsFY14FY15FY16FY17FY18FY19FY20FY21£m02040608010012014016004Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021INNOVATIONpRoDucInG MoRe sustAInABle  BReeDInG AnIMAls FoR FARMeRsGENUS AT A GLANCEWHAT WE DOGenus is a world-leading animal genetics company.We partner with farmers to nourish the world more efficiently and sustainably.We do this by breeding better pigs and cattle, so farmers can produce high-quality meat and milk more efficiently and sustainably. We accurately select animals with desirable characteristics and use them to breed subsequent generations.Examples of desirable characteristics include feed efficiency, disease resistance, growth rate, protein and fat content,  and fertility.HOW WE DO ITWe analyse animals’ DNA and look for markers that  we know are linked to desirable characteristics, which help farmers to  raise healthier and more sustainable animals.We then select animals with the strongest genetic profile from our proprietary and partner herds and breed them to produce even better offspring, in a continuous cycle. We distribute these genetically superior animals to our customers in the form of breeding animals, semen or embryos.We also own technology that enables us to screen and process semen for desirable traits, such as producing female offspring for the dairy market, and license-in technology to make precise gene edits to animals’ DNA, which we are employing in our R&D programmes, for example to produce pigs which are resistant to fatal disease.Our focus is on progressive farmers, who are best placed to realise the benefits of superior genetics and technologies.INVESTING TO STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION11 Restated following an April 2021 IFRIC Interpretation Committee agenda decision that resulted in previously capitalised software assets being expensed.2 Includes net investments in biological assets.3 Includes finance lease payments.\f05STRATEGIC REPORTPORK87654321DAIRY & BEEF7654321REVENUE3ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT3, 4CUSTOMERS GLOBALLYMARKET SHARE1, 2£315.6m£135.9m2,000+£250.1m£36.4m50,000+PIC, our global porcine genetics business, sells genetically superior breeding pigs and semen to farmers, so they can breed commercial pigs with desirable characteristics for pork production.  We also provide technical services and advice  to farmers, to maximise the performance of our breeding animals in their farms.PIC owns over ten elite pure-bred pig lines, housed in strategically located biosecure facilities. These  pigs are bred out into much larger breeding herds in over 500 predominantly sub-contracted ‘multiplication’ farms around the world, many of which are operated by customers themselves. PIC boars  are also housed in over 400 boar studs globally, where semen is collected for distribution to  customers and multiplication herds.PIC genetics are sold under the PIC brand through direct sales channels and strategic partners.ABS, our global bovine genetics business, sells dairy and beef bull semen and embryos from our superior cattle, which are sold to farmers to breed their cows through artificial insemination. The resulting calves will then exhibit desirable characteristics for milk and beef production. ABS’s highest-quality semen is often sold in sexed form, which greatly increases the probability of a female calf. ABS also provides technical services to farmers, to maximise the performance of their animals bred with our genetics.ABS breeds genetically elite bulls in the US, Europe, Latin America and India. The best bulls come to one of ABS’s six stud locations, where their semen is collected for distribution as a frozen ‘straw’ of semen or used to create embryos for sale.ABS genetics are sold through direct sales channels and strategic partners under the ABS brand. In the UK and France, they are sold under long-established Genus and Bovec brands.SERVING PORK, DAIRY AND BEEF FARMERS GLOBALLYGenus’s leading porcine and bovine animal breeding divisions, PIC and ABS, deliver genetically elite breeding animals to thousands of farmers globally.1 Source: Government agencies, Eurostat, pork organisations, Genus estimates.

Bob was a strong advocate for investment in science and the application of that science to our world. The success Genus is enjoying today is the result of that accumulated investment over many years.PERFORMANCE AND DIVIDENDThe Group delivered a strong and balanced performance in 2021, with  both PIC and ABS contributing to growth. Almost all regions were ahead of the previous year and trading was particularly good in China, Brazil, Russia and India. The Group’s adjusted profit before tax was £84.8m, up by 38% in constant currency and 29% in actual currency. Statutory PBT was £55.8m (2020 restated: £46.3m).We recognise the importance of balancing our investment for the future with ensuring an attractive return for shareholders. The Board is therefore recommending a final dividend of 21.7p per share, which will give a total dividend of 32.0p, including the interim dividend of 10.3p per share paid in April 2021. This will result in growth in the total dividend of 10%. The final dividend will be paid on 10 December 2021, to shareholders  on the register at the close of business  on 19 November 2021.the Group delivered a strong and balanced performance in 2021, with both pIc and ABs contributing  to growth.IAIN FERGUSONPROGRESSposItIonInG tHe GRoup  FoR FuRtHeR successCHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT\f07STRATEGIC REPORTSTRATEGYGenus is a long-cycle business and one of the Board’s key jobs is to keep looking to the future. We continually scan the horizon, to ensure we identify developments in our industry and related sectors, understand our competition and have access to important new science and technology. This activity will underpin the Group’s continuing success over the next five to ten years.The Board held its annual strategy session during the year, which confirmed to us that the strategy remains appropriate. Our priorities are also unchanged. The Group will continue to invest, to protect and build on the strong positions of its bovine and porcine businesses, and we will seek opportunities to apply Genus’s science base to other species where  they can add value for shareholders.Genus is purpose-led, with our vision clearly setting out our goal of using innovation to nourish the world. Our strategy is aligned to this purpose, as is our focus on sustainability, which I see as intrinsic to our licence to operate. Delivering improved outcomes for farmers, while reducing the amount of feed and other natural resources required, is a  core part of our breeding programmes. We are also committed to improving  our own environmental footprint.BOARDI joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2020 and succeeded Bob Lawson as Chairman on his retirement, following the AGM on 25 November 2020. There were two other changes to the Board during the year, with Professor Jason Chin being appointed as a Non-Executive Director from 1 April 2021 and Professor Ian Charles retiring from the Board on 31 May 2021. Jason has deep scientific expertise, as Head of the Centre for Chemical and Synthetic Biology at the Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Biology, in Cambridge. He is therefore ideally positioned to act as scientific adviser to the Genus Portfolio Steering Committee, a role Ian Charles filled with distinction for more than three years. We thank Ian for his significant contribution during his time on the Board, which included helping us to understand the biome and the importance of reproductive biology.PEOPLEGenus employs over 3,400 talented and dedicated people around the world. They have shown real commitment and flexibility this year, helping us to successfully deliver for our customers and keep our research programmes on track during COVID-19. The pandemic has really underscored the strength of the working relationships across the Group, as well as our people’s ability to take on new challenges and adapt to new technology. While the situation in countries such as the UK and US has eased in recent months, we have significant businesses in India, Brazil and other countries that have continued to be hard hit. Unfortunately, we have lost two colleagues to COVID-19 and our thoughts are with their families and friends. LOOKING FORWARDGenus has the platform and resources to invest for the future and maintain our virtuous cycle. We will continue to select the best technology, science and partners, and work to deliver continuous genetic improvement. By taking this to our customers and sharing in the value we create for them, we will continue to reinvest in R&D, our people and world-class facilities to further grow our market leadership. This consistent investment is the driver of our long-term success and our commitment to it gives us confidence in Genus’s future.Iain Ferguson CBEChairman of the Board8 September 2021\f08Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021This was a very successful year for Genus. We delivered a very strong operational and financial performance, made further significant progress with our strategy and continued to drive our innovation agenda, as we strive to fulfil our vision of ‘Pioneering animal genetic improvement to help nourish the world’. Advancing sustainability has always been fundamental to our business and vision, and we have made good progress with our ESG agenda in the year.GROUP PERFORMANCEThe Group’s financial performance was excellent, with Genus achieving its fastest profit before tax growth rate in over ten years despite the currency headwinds. Revenue rose by 4% and adjusted profit before tax of £84.8m was 29% higher, or 38% in constant currency.Both businesses achieved growth in their key metrics. In constant currency, Genus PIC’s revenue increased by 11% and the strategically important porcine royalty revenue was 11% higher. This contributed to adjusted operating profit including joint ventures being 16% up in constant currency. All regions contributed to this growth, with China a key driver as producers restocked as a result of African Swine Fever. Russia and Brazil were also particularly strong.Genus ABS increased revenue and adjusted operating profit by 13% and 21% respectively, in constant currency. This was underpinned by a 15% increase in volumes. Sexed volumes grew by 29%, reflecting the ongoing success of Sexcel, and global beef volumes were 22% higher, supported by increased use of NuEra beef genetics in dairy herds. Again, growth was broadly spread geographically, with Brazil, Russia, India and China all performing well.We continued to invest significantly in R&D, so we can bring the benefits of the latest and best science to our customers. Net R&D expenditure was £62.5m in the year (up 2% in constant currency), with primary research expenditure in addition to gene editing increasing 42% in constant currency to £13.3m. We have further strengthened our differentiated and proprietary offerings and invested in key strategic initiatives, including gene editing, the next generation of IntelliGen technology (‘Gen2’), and reproductive biology, as well as further developing our R&D pipeline.STRATEGIC PROGRESSOur PRRSv-resistance programme is making pleasing progress, with the successful completion of two rounds of disease trials of our gene-edited pigs. We have a defined path to regulatory approval, including the timeline to complete our Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) submissions and the steps we need to take to achieve this.

We mean what we say and do what we say.Read more on p.38 – p.43In China, we are collaborating successfully with our partner BCA, which is engaging positively with the Chinese regulatory authorities.We continue to drive innovation across the Group, including delivering further improvements to our IntelliGen technology. We have now launched Gen2 of IntelliGen, which is more compact, effective and efficient than the previous generation technology. It has been introduced in our Dekorra, Wisconsin facility and we plan to introduce it shortly to our new facility at Leeds, Wisconsin, which started to receive bulls in the summer of 2021. In addition, we have launched a major new R&D programme in reproductive biology and have established a new world-class  team in this area.The implementation of GenusOne,  our new enterprise system, is continuing. We completed the roll out in North America and in Spain during the year and are now working on the roll out to the remainder of the Group over the next two years. GenusOne will be a key enabler of leveraging our scale at a Group level and giving greater visibility of business data. As we roll out GenusOne, we are also introducing a new target operating model to standardise our procurement, and financial processes and reporting worldwide.Investing in our digital capabilities in our interactions with customers is another important theme. Our ABS business in Latin America has had great success through digital sales during COVID-19 and we will introduce more digital customer engagement across ABS, to enhance the customer experience. To support our scientific programmes, we are also investing in data science, to help us extract new insights from the rapidly expanding sources of data being generated by farmers.Spain is the world’s fourth largest porcine market and we have expanded our supply chain and market share in the male side of the business, through the acquisition of Sergal, a leading Spanish boar stud operator. In addition, we have taken a minority stake in Xelect, an aqua genetic improvement consultancy based in Scotland. We are pleased to have started a partnership in this space and look forward to the opportunities this may open up to gain a presence in the fast-growing aqua genetics market.Finally, we are investing at a record pace in new facilities to lay the foundations for continuing future growth, including new bull housing and IntelliGen production facilities, a major new porcine nucleus in Canada, a boar stud in Russia and new porcine capacity in China.ADVANCING ESG Sustainability in particular, is at the core of our business. The ongoing genetic improvement we deliver helps farmers to produce more protein with fewer resources and a lower carbon footprint, whether that is through producing pigs which convert feed more efficiently into growth or enhancing the productivity of dairy cows. We have commitments to reduce our own carbon footprint by 25% by 2030 and have a roadmap and planned investments to achieve this. In the year our carbon emissions reduced by 6.8% and our primary intensity ratio reduced by 0.2%, with a cumulative primary intensity ratio reduction against the 2019 base year of 11.3% achieved towards the 2030 goal. PEOPLETo achieve our vision of pioneering animal genetic improvement to help nourish the world, we need to attract, develop and retain outstanding people. The Genus Executive Leadership Team was unchanged during the year and we continued to add to our strength in depth, hiring talented leaders to head up data science, reproductive biology and genomics. Our AWAKE programme, which aims to empower women to succeed in Genus, is gathering momentum, reflecting the importance we place on diversity. We have rolled out improvements in learning and development, to help our people thrive. Employee engagement measured through surveys remains high. While the Group has demonstrated its resilience in the face of COVID-19, we know that the pandemic has placed a significant strain on our people. We have consistently focused on protecting their health and well-being, and they in turn have risen to the challenge of serving our customers and keeping the business moving ahead. As a gesture of gratitude, I was pleased to announce a special additional payment of £500 to all employees around the world to thank them for their commitment and contribution this year.OUTLOOKLooking ahead, the outlook for the Group remains positive and we are confident in our strategy and the many opportunities for Genus. Group performance in FY20 and FY21 was very strong, with good growth across both ABS and PIC, led in particular by strong growth in PIC China, where the opportunity remains large. However, recent volatility in the Chinese porcine market is expected to continue for some months, creating a short-term headwind in FY22, primarily for PIC China. As a result of this headwind, and despite expected strong performance in the other areas of the business, we expect Genus’s growth to be lower than our medium-term goal in the current year before increasing again in FY23.Stephen WilsonChief Executive8 September 2021\f10Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021DELIVERINGpRoDucInG AnD DelIVeRInG MoRe  sustAInABle AnIMAls to FARMeRsBUSINESS MODELPRODUCE GENETICALLY  SUPERIOR BREEDING ANIMALSOUR STRENGTHS  AND RESOURCES SHARED PROPRIETARY  TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM GLOBAL POSITIONGenus is uniquely placed as a global player, with leading brands and market positions, which we strengthen through acquisitions and partnershipsELITE ANIMALSWe own elite porcine and bovine herds, which produce animal protein more efficiently and have traits farmers valuePROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGYWe harness leading genetic and breeding technologies, which we develop in-house and through strategic partnershipsCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPSWe serve over 50,000 customers globally, including most of both the Top 100 pig producers and dairies globallyEXPERT PEOPLEWe have over 3,400 employees, including over 100 PhD qualified employees, and relationships with leading research institutionsGLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINWe have production facilities in key locations worldwide, coupled with sales forces and agents in over 80 countriesFINANCIAL STRENGTH AND SCALEOur cash generative businesses and scale allow us to fund strategic investments and deliver improved returnsGENOME SCIENCE AND BIOINFORMATICSWe understand the links between DNA and animals’ observable characteristics, and how we can influence themGENOMIC SELECTIONWe breed successive generations of animals by using DNA analysis to select superior parents in our breeding herdsBIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERINGWe use technology to interrogate and select cells, such as in our semen sexing technologyGENE EDITINGWe are developing more sustainable, disease-resistant breeding animals by making precise changes to their genesREPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGYWe have active R&D workstreams in multiple advanced reproductive technologies, such as IVF, which enable us to select both female and male parents for superior offspring\f11STRATEGIC REPORT1 GHGs relates to greenhouse gas emissions.DELIVERING FOR  OUR STAKEHOLDERS DELIVER MORE SUSTAINABLE BREEDING ANIMALS AND SERVICES TO FARMERSPRICE ACCORDING  TO THE VALUE DELIVEREDWe have a global supply chain that efficiently delivers genetics to customers while mitigating risk for us, for example through our use of third-party multipliers.

The continued adoption of selective breeding and new technologies will help farmers to meet the growing demand for protein.DEMAND DRIVERS FOR GENETIC IMPROVEMENTDEMAND FOR ANIMAL PROTEIN IS GROWINGThe global population is expanding and urbanising, and seeking a more varied and nutritious diet. Pork, milk and beef consumption are forecast to grow by 1–2% p.a. in the next decade.FOOD PRODUCTION MUST BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLECompetition for resources, such as land and water, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, puts pressure on farmers to become more efficient, through the use of genetically superior animals and other technologies. CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING BETTER PRODUCTSConsumers are increasingly demanding healthier and more sustainable products, which are traceable and produced with fewer drugs. This increases farmers’ demand for genetically superior breeding animals, which are naturally more efficient and resilient.FARMS ARE CONSOLIDATING AND TECHNIFYINGProgressive farmers, who are more open to new technologies and measure performance in more detail, are consolidating the sector. They understand the benefits of genetically superior animals and optimised breeding strategies, such as combining the use of sexed dairy and beef semen on dairy herds to maximise profit.FEEDINGtHe WoRlD MoRe sustAInABlYMARKET OVERVIEWUS MILK PRODUCTION VS.

The increasing use of costly technology and the scale required to keep pace with industry leaders is driving consolidation of these herds. As genetics consolidate, some breeders are forming strategic alliances with competitors, so they can offer their customers superior genetics.ADOPTION OF SEXING TECHNOLOGYCows must be impregnated to produce milk so dairy farmers need to regularly breed their animals and refresh their milking herds. Using sexed semen yields approximately 90% female offspring, enabling dairy farmers to refresh their milking herd with fewer, higher quality breedings. This enables them to breed  the rest of the herd with beef semen, which maximises the meat quality (and value) of the resulting calf.BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND DATAGenus is developing innovative solutions to combat disease and improve animal welfare, which also have the potential to dramatically increase protein sustainability. These include development of health-focused indices to select optimal breeding animals, as well as employing gene editing and advanced reproductive technologies. Progressive farmers are also increasingly leveraging digital technologies, which provide data and insight to support decision making.1 Source: Genus analysis; US Holstein breeders represented in the Top 200 NM$ rankings by birth year; 2021 data based on Top 200 Holsteins active using August 2021 data from the Council on Dairy Cattle Breeding.Dairy genetics herds have rapidly consolidated leading to better quality animals for dairy farmers. 1 Source: USDA.1 Sexed includes embryos.\f16Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021We harness innovative technologies and  know-how to breed  genetically superior animals for progressive farmers, and link our pricing to the performance of our products on-farm.STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATIONOur overarching strategy, success drivers (which feed into the focus areas of our business model), and associated KPIs are determined at Group level.

Whilst ASF continues to cause challenges in Asia, the disease has continued to spread west across Europe with Eastern Germany recently announcing the first cases of ASF in its swine population. Complications from COVID-19 including labour shortages, meat packing capacity, retail food service demand and international logistics delays also continued to impact global pig production. Feed input costs rose due to weather patterns and robust demand, resulting in the highest grain prices in recent years. In the near-term, ASF, feed input costs and COVID-19 implications will continue to exert pressure on the global porcine industry.China’s pork sector is experiencing uncertainty affecting production and profitability due to market price volatility, stagnant demand and ongoing challenges with the ASF recovery. Soaring pork prices in 2020 suppressed demand, whilst domestic supply increased as production recovered, and foreign  imports continued. Outbreaks of ASF during the winter months also resulted  in a surge of slaughter of animals in 2021, further contributing to increased supply. Consequently, domestic pig prices have dropped approximately 50% since the beginning of 2021, which combined with high input costs, caused a collapse of producers’ margins. Despite China’s efforts to rebuild its herd, Rabobank estimates that inventory still remains below 2018 pre-ASF numbers due to ASF Actual currencyConstant currency change%Year ended 30 June2021£m2020£mChange%Revenue315.6298.8611Adjusted operating profit exc JV122.9113.3814Adjusted operating profit inc JV135.9124.3916Adjusted operating margin exc JV38.9%37.9%1.0pts1.0ptsoutbreaks in 2020 and 2021. Prices are expected to remain volatile for some months reflecting producers’ investments in production capacity coming on stream, seasonal demand trends and the release of inventories of frozen pork accumulated by importers. In Europe, the outbreak of ASF in Eastern Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic and new regulations have collectively resulted in challenging market conditions for producers. However, pig prices recovered in early 2021 due to the inventory reductions from sow liquidations in several countries, as well as ongoing demand from China. European pork exports increased by 24% versus the prior year, with China being the key driver. New animal welfare and environmental management standards have also caused large concerns in parts of the European industry, especially in Germany and Netherlands. These standards will require additional investments and may well result in further sow inventory reductions. Recent cancellation of certain export licences granted by China, in reaction to the supply imbalance currently experienced in China, is expected to have an adverse impact on European producers due to the reduction of exports to China.The US industry has experienced sustained high pig prices throughout 2021, due to strong domestic and international demand, with the latter exceeding expectations. Spot pig prices have increased more than $75/cwt in the US since the start of the year. US pork exports were 1% higher than the prior year, totalling 3.83 billion lbs through June 2021.

According to USDA projections, total US pork exports for 2021 are expected to be flat to marginally lower year on year, while pig production  is forecast to be largely unchanged  from 2020.Brazil’s pork exports are the largest in the South American pork industry. Its share of global pork exports is forecast to be 11%  in 2021, with the primary destination  being China.PERFORMANCEGenus PIC’s adjusted operating profits for the year were £135.9m, up 16% in constant currency. This performance was driven by very strong growth in many countries, in particular China, Russia and Brazil. Volumes were up 11%, with all regions contributing and the highest growth in Asia and Europe. Total revenue increased by 11% in constant currency and strategically important porcine royalty revenue was also up 11% in constant currency. In North America, COVID-19 caused packing plant slowdowns in the first half of FY21. Market conditions improved in the second half, contributing to full year adjusted operating profit growth of 1% in constant currency. Volumes grew by 3% but royalty revenue declined 1%, due to reduced breeding activities by certain customers affected by the impact of plant slowdowns, and certain customers experiencing PRRSv outbreaks in the second half of FY21. However, key account wins on our damline products and strong sales growth on the PIC800 sire line, provides momentum going into FY22.Latin America’s adjusted operating profit grew by 17% in constant currency, with all the major countries contributing. Volumes were up 7% and royalty revenues were up 9% in constant currency. In Brazil, strong export demand from China fuelled significant industry expansion and drove almost 40% operating profit growth in our joint venture with Agroceres. To continue to meet increasing demand, Agroceres PIC has begun constructing a new genetic nucleus farm to house 3,600 elite animals and produce up to 110,000 breeding animals per year. Although revenue in Europe was essentially unchanged, adjusted operating profit rose by 13% in constant currency. Breeding stock sales were lower due to large key account stockings in the prior year. However, royalty revenues were up 11% in constant currency, with nearly all countries achieving growth. Expansion projects in Russia continued to drive strong royalty growth and delivered profit growth of 24% in constant currency. In Spain, Genus PIC entered into a strategic relationship with Sergal, a leading porcine distributor, to acquire and integrate its semen supply chain. This will support continued long-term growth with pork producers in the important Spanish market.Asia’s adjusted operating profit grew by 49% in constant currency. The strength in pig prices for the majority of the year supported continued growth in customer breeding projects, and improved margins from by-product sales in Genus PIC’s owned farms in China. China’s royalty revenues grew strongly and were 121% higher. However, country-wide health challenges in the second half of the year, along with a sharp decline in market pig prices, resulted in some near-term sales volatility as well as impacting owned farm profit margins from the sale of by-product slaughter pigs. This volatility is expected to continue through FY22. In the Philippines, the industry has started to show signs of recovery following the impacts of COVID-19 and ASF. Despite a volume decline of 3%, operating profit increased by 48% in constant currency.  >Delivered further increases in genetic merit across all targeted traits  >Continued to expand our network of elite nucleus farms; started construction on a joint venture genetic nucleus in Brazil and a new owned elite nucleus in Canada  >Increased global dissemination of elite genetics despite constraints created by COVID-19, flying 18,500 animals to 26 countries, including 13,000 pureline gilts to multiplication facilities in Russia and ChinaDELIVERING A DIFFERENTIATED PROPRIETARY GENETIC OFFERING >Grew adjusted operating profits in Asia by 49%, driven particularly by increasing demand in China and underpinned by further expansion of our local supply chain  >Delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 13% across Europe, aided by our focus on large producers and expansion of our distribution network to support smaller customers  >Maintained previous performance levels in North America, despite  the local impact of COVID-19, helped by sales of our PIC800  boar through new accounts  with large producers  >Increased adjusted operating profit in Latin America by 17%, with particularly strong performance from Brazil FOCUSING ON LARGE AND PROGRESSIVE PROTEIN PRODUCERS GLOBALLY >Agreed further royalty contracts around the world, so that 78% of our business is now conducted on this basis (including 36% of our business in China) >Strengthened our relationship with a major integrated producer in Latin America, through a contract that will see royalty payments increase each year, consistent with the incremental and cumulative value PIC genetics bring to its business  >Conducted a further 28 product trials, involving 87,056 pigs, to show producers the benefits of using PIC genetics in their systems SHARING IN THE VALUE DELIVERED\fGenus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202120NEW FACILITY SUPPORTS OUR SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS GROWTHIn August 2020 Genus PIC began construction of a 370,000 square-foot nucleus farm in Canada. This facility will house 2,000 elite females which will enhance our capacity and support growth in key markets, including Russia and South America. We carefully selected the farm’s location and layout to ensure the highest health standards. Canada is recognised as a ‘high health’ export market and the farm itself is isolated from other pig operations, yet close to export facilities. The farm’s design will facilitate physical security, cleaning procedures and handling of biosecure feed and semen. The site’s dedicated export facility and truck wash will ensure that high-health breeding pigs can be exported quickly and effectively in line with best practice. We have designed the farm with sustainability and animal well-being in mind. Features include computerised ventilation, heating and cooling, using on-site composting to create fertiliser for feed crops and energy saving measures such as LED lighting. The farm will hold pigs from birth to maturity, so no animals will need to be transported during their growth phase, minimising stress for the pigs. Combined with a square footage per animal that exceeds regulations, this will help each animal to maximise its genetic expression, benefiting them and our customers.SUSTAINABLEBusIness GRoWtHGENUS PIC CASE STUDY\f21STRATEGIC REPORT370,000sq. ftCanadalocation2,000 elite females\f22Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021PARTNERINGcReAtInG AnD sHARInG In VAlueOPERATING REVIEW / GENUS ABSBUSINESS PRIORITIESSHORT TERMEnhance the digital customer experience MEDIUM TERMMove US production and lab work onto our new Leeds site in Wisconsin Accelerate growth in target markets while continuing to strengthen product development LONG TERMExpand our range of exclusive relationships with producers around the world, based on performance-based contracts and pricingMARKET Strong global demand for dairy products and the easing of COVID-19 lockdowns helped drive up the Fonterra Whole Milk Powder auction price by 25% over the last 12 months. Increased demand in China and other Asian markets was important in supporting these prices. Markets such as Brazil saw record milk prices, underpinned by government initiatives to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary pressures.This strong demand boosted EU dairy production in the first half of 2021, with prices up 9% over the prior year. However, unfavourable weather during planting resulted in higher feed costs, dampening profitability. The US dairy herd was 9.5 million cows by May 2021, its highest level in over 20 years. Along with higher yields, this is expected to increase milk production by 2.4% during 2021.  China dairy imports were also up through the year, particularly in Q1 2021 which saw milk and cream, whey and cheese imports rise more than 50% over the prior year, when COVID-19 hampered international trade. These imports were mainly fulfilled by New Zealand, Germany, the US and Australia.Industry forecasts suggest 1% growth in 2021 for milk production in regions where supply exceeds domestic demand. This compares with 1.4% growth in 2020, with most coming from the US and EU. However, continued feed cost increases in these regions will put pressure on production margins and likely restrict short-term supply growth.Actual currencyConstant currency change%Year ended 30 June2021£m2020£mChange%Revenue250.1237.6513Adjusted operating profit 36.432.51221Adjusted operating margin14.6%13.7%0.9pts1.0ptsWorldwide beef demand was particularly strong throughout the year. ASF’s impact on pork in China has increased import demand for beef and the post-COVID-19 reopening of US foodservice and retail over the last six months also contributed. This has significantly increased beef prices, particularly in Brazil (up 40%) and the US (up 10%). In Brazil, this has been exacerbated by lower supply levels due to poor pasture growth, COVID-19 disruptions and farmers holding  onto cattle until they reached their desired weights.However, Brazil still reached a new global record for beef exports in 2020, due to rising production, a weak domestic market, a much lower exchange rate and strong demand from China. Brazilian beef remains very price competitive given its large production capacity and heavily depressed economy and currency. USDA forecasts indicate that Brazilian beef exports could grow by 5% in 2021, further challenging Australia’s market share.overall demand for ABs’s products remained resilient in FY21.DR NATE ZWALDCHIEF OPERATING OFFICERGENUS ABS DAIRYJERRY THOMPSONCHIEF OPERATING OFFICERGENUS ABS BEEF\f23STRATEGIC REPORTSTRATEGIC PROGRESS IN 2020/21In the bovine genetics marketplace, the significant investment required to run competitive breeding programmes saw a number of trading partnerships develop during the year, particularly between European co-operatives. This trend is likely to continue, as a smaller number of growing dairy and beef producers want to partner with world-class genetics companies, to help them grow sustainable protein production.PERFORMANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to challenge our customers, despite the pandemic easing in some countries. However, overall demand for ABS’s products has remained resilient with the ABS salesforce focus on obtaining all of their customers’ business. This has included good uptake on new partnership contracts which include an outcome based pricing model.ABS’s adjusted operating profit increased by 21%, with volumes up 15% and revenue up 13% in constant currency. Dairy customers continued to demand sexed and beef genetics, with sexed volumes up 29% and beef volumes being 22% higher. This is reflected in Sexcel’s continued success, the growing use of NuEra beef genetics in dairy herds and customer growth in the traditional beef segment. Europe grew both volumes and revenue by 7%, with adjusted operating profit 14% higher in constant currency. Sexed semen volumes rose by 43%, with the UK, Italy and the European distributor business growing fastest. In Russia, the business made strategic progress with key accounts and delivered strong operating profit growth of 117% in constant currency. We also achieved strong growth in other distributor markets, however COVID-19 lockdowns in January and February significantly reduced customer access, and with dairy producers limiting their herd growth, conditions in the UK and Europe were challenging during the second half of the year. Good progress was made on moving customers to partnership-based contracts and the ABS breeder tag system uptake has been very encouraging. A new third-party IntelliGen production facility that opened in Europe in the first half of the year was successfully validated and put into full operation.North American revenue was unchanged and adjusted operating profit fell by 13% in constant currency. We increased investment in strategic key account management and marketing during the year, however COVID-19 travel restrictions continued to have a short-term impact on sales. Volumes declined by 2% due to reduced face-to-face customer interactions and uncertain market conditions causing dairy producers to rationalise their genetic inventory on-farm. Beef-on-dairy volumes rose 19%, supported by proprietary NuEra genetics selected for cross-bred beef-on-dairy performance and sexed volumes were 1% higher, however customers used less conventional product. There was also lower IntelliGen profit due to a planned technology transfer in the prior year. In Latin America, revenue grew by 32% and adjusted operating profit increased by 67% in constant currency. Performance in Brazil was particularly good, reflecting the strength of the Brazilian beef market, the team’s innovative digital sales campaigns and our robust pricing policies. Overall volumes in Latin America were 20% higher, with sexed volumes up 36% and beef volumes up 37%, utilising NuEra genetics selected for cross-bred performance of North American sires with tropical cows. Embryo volumes increased by 36%.In Asia, adjusted operating profit was up 53% and volumes grew 36%. Trading grew in China, following a period of vertical integration among customers, as dairy processors acquired farms. After the end of a multi-year drought and bushfires in 2019/20, Australia’s customer demand bounced back strongly. Sexed volumes in Asia rose 64%, with strong Sexcel sales in China. The year also saw strong performance in our India business and the signing of our fourth government sexed semen contract in India. >Continued to generate industry-leading dairy bulls and established our Elite Sire programme, offering customers early access to genomic sires of high genetic merit  >Increased the number of NuEra beef bulls in our nucleus facilities and brought more of these high genetic merit animals into production for customers  >Grew global sales volumes of sexed genetics (including Sexcel, our proprietary product) by 29%, NuEra Genetics by 53% and Beef InFocus (our global beef-on-dairy brand) by 15% DELIVERING A DIFFERENTIATED PROPRIETARY GENETIC OFFERING >Continued to increase sales of Sexcel in new and existing markets, with particularly strong performance in China (up 151%)  and Russia (up 154%) >Increased use of digital sales platforms in Latin America, contributing to volume growth of 20% (17% of which came from new customers), especially in Brazil  (up 33%)  >Strengthened our service to the largest herds in the US, by establishing a strategic account management team to support current and potential customers  >Enhanced our BeefAdvantage index in the UK, by adding feed efficiency as a selection trait, using market-focused performance data FOCUSING ON LARGE AND PROGRESSIVE PROTEIN PRODUCERS GLOBALLY >Enrolled over 125 large customers in our Key Account Partner Program, through which we become their exclusive genetic partner and provide a holistic service for a monthly fee  >Conducted two beef validation trials with feeders and packers around the world, to demonstrate the superior performance of NuEra Genetics and increase demand through the supply chain SHARING IN THE VALUE DELIVERED\f00000000000000024Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021ENGAGINGWItH pRoGRessIVe BeeF FARMeRs tHRouGH  InnoVAtIVe sAles cHAnnelsGENUS ABS CASE STUDYAraguianaBrazil\f25STRATEGIC REPORTENGAGING WITH PROGRESSIVE BEEF FARMERS THROUGH INNOVATIVE  SALES CHANNELSMarcos Albino is a Nelore cattle breeder at the 800 cow Maranata Ranch in Araguiana, Brazil, and has historically never used artificial insemination. In 2019 Marcos was invited by the ABS team to participate in ABS’s ‘Black Week’ digital sales event, during which Marcos acquired 200 ABS embryos produced with ABS’s leading Nelore genetics, sexed with our proprietary sexing technology. A high proportion of these breedings resulted in high-quality female calves, enabling Marcus to rapidly transform the performance and sustainability of his herd in a single breeding event.As a result of Marcos’s positive experience and support from ABS’s technical services team, he has developed a strong working relationship with ABS and has since invested in additional embryos. The relationship has now progressed beyond the acquisition of genetics and Marcos has decided to employ ABS’s IVB NEO service, which will enable him to create embryos from his best males and females to breed his next generations, thereby dramatically accelerating the genetic improvement in his herd.\f26Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021PERFORMANCEDuring the year, Genus continued to strengthen its proprietary differentiated offerings and to invest in key strategic initiatives, including gene editing, IntelliGen production capacity and porcine elite farm nucleuses, as well as further developing its research and development pipeline. Net research and development investment increased by 2% in constant currency, with the prior year having included large investments to expand the porcine elite nucleus populations. External research collaboration spend was lower, due to delays in spending caused by COVID-19 constraints, and the Group also benefited from efficiencies in its gene editing programme, by internalising gene editing capabilities. Porcine product development continues to deliver high rates of genetic improvement, driven by the combination of our expanded genetic production, implementation of best science and our capture of accurate and meaningful data. Ongoing improvement initiatives are focused on further refining our genomic evaluation, exploring precision measurement tools utilising new technologies such as video imaging, and continuing the integration of Møllevang genetics for maximum product differentiation. Rates of genetic gain and the results from product validation trials demonstrate that these investments are increasing our realised rates of improvement.

The De  Novo joint venture continued to produce more than 50% of these animals and  the strong pipeline of young bulls will  help sustain our leadership position. Global demand for NuEra genetics  grew further and represented more than 30% of our total beef volumes. Recent validation trials in customer systems have demonstrated NuEra’s significant superiority to competitor genetics. In addition, we have now validated and \f27STRATEGIC REPORTSTRATEGIC PROGRESS IN 2020/21launched our IntelliGen Gen2.0 (‘Gen2’) equipment at our Dekorra facility, which will provide further production efficiencies and further strengthen our product quality. We continue to invest in IntelliGen with the launch of Gen2, while amortising previously capitalised development costs. We expect to expand our production capacity further, to meet increasing demand for sexed semen.Net gene editing expenditure rose  by 54% in the year, mainly due to FY20 having included net income of £3.2m recognised for a milestone payment received from our Chinese partner, BCA. Excluding BCA income, gene editing expenditures were 5% lower. Our work with Caribou completed and we internalised our capability for producing gene edited animals, as intended. The PRRSv programme is progressing as planned, and we maintained our engagement with the FDA, with whom we have a constructive and positive relationship. We also initiated conversations, both directly and with local partners, on regulatory and market acceptance in key global markets, including China and Japan.Other research and development expenditure increased by 42%. This included initiating work on reproductive biology and data science objectives, and continuing efforts in our bioinformatics platform and genome science. External collaborations in a variety of discovery areas also continued, though at a slower pace due to institutions prioritising COVID-19 research and vaccines. >Conducted further trials on our gene-edited pigs, demonstrating complete resistance to two prevalent types of PRRSv, and made our second submission for regulatory approval in the US  >With our partner BCA, increased interactions with MARA and progressed in-country lab and production facilities >Continued our collaboration with Kansas State University to evaluate opportunities for combating swine influenza and African Swine FeverGENE  EDITING  >Introduced a second generation of our industry-leading sexing technology to enhance ease of operation, improve efficiency and increase the gender skew rate of each unit produced  >Increased production capacity to help ABS meet global demand for its sexed semen product, Sexcel  >Continued to expand our network of IntelliGen Technologies laboratories, which now number 11 owned and licensed facilities across four continents GENDER  SKEW  >Harnessed new techniques and technologies to improve our system for IVF, enhancing the quality and quantity of embryos produced internally and within licensed laboratories >Started exploring the benefits of working with embryonic stem cells to accelerate genetic gain, through collaborations with the University  of California Davis and Missouri State University  >Developed a data and analytics strategy and implemented initiatives on scalable hybrid computing, flexible storage and cataloguing of assets to strengthen data science capabilities and support innovationREPRODUCTIVE  BIOLOGY DATA  STRATEGY\f28Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021PRRSv is a devastating disease that causes significant animal suffering and billions of dollars in losses in global pig production annually. PRRSv cannot be effectively prevented or eliminated through traditional veterinary medicine or vaccination. Genus has pioneered the development of a gene editing solution that has proven to confer complete resistance to PRRSv in pigs, making animals healthier and our food supply safer and more sustainable.During FY21, we made great progress and met our programme milestones. We completed live animal challenge trials, with our pigs demonstrating 100% resistance to both Type I (US and European) and Type II (US and Asia) PRRSv, confirming previous academic findings. To commercialise our PRRSv-resistant pigs, regulatory approval is key. We were therefore pleased to submit the first two product claim and method filings to the US Food and Drug Administration. Our path to regulatory approval and commercial launch is clear, and this year’s progress has moved us closer towards our goal of eradicating this devastating disease.DEVELOPINGpIGs WItH ResIstAnce  to A DeVAstAtInG DIseAseGENUS R&D CASE STUDY\f29STRATEGIC REPORT\f30Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021In the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group’s overall performance was very strong despite some ongoing impacts from COVID-19. The resilience of our operations was reflected in revenue growth of 4% (10% in constant currency) and adjusted operating profit growth including joint ventures of 27% (36% in constant currency) on a restated basis (see below). This was after another year of significant investment in R&D of £62.5m (up 2% in constant currency, down 4% in actual currency). Excluding gene editing costs, adjusted operating profit including joint ventures increased by 37% in constant currency and adjusted profit before tax was up 38% (29% in actual currency).In line with the IFRIC Interpretation Committee’s new agenda decision published in April 2021, the Group has changed its accounting policy related to the capitalisation of certain software assets. This change relates to the capitalisation of costs of configuring or customising application software under ‘Software as a Service’ (SaaS) arrangements. As a result, we are capitalising less of our GenusOne costs as the system is a Microsoft Dynamics 365 SaaS solution. This change in accounting policy led to an increase in operating expenses amounting to £2.7m in the current year and £5.2m for FY20. All FY20 results are restated. For full  details of the impact see Note 2 Basis of Preparation.On a statutory basis, profit before tax was £55.8m (2020 restated: £46.3m). The difference between statutory and adjusted profit before tax principally reflected the reduction in the non-cash fair value net IAS 41 biological assets, versus an increase last year, and lower exceptional items, principally due to the prior year reflecting £16.4m of litigation fees and damages. Basic earnings per share on a statutory basis were 72.6 pence (2020 restated: 54.4 pence).Genus continues to report adjusted results as Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’), which are used by the Board to monitor underlying performance at a Group and operating segment level and are applied consistently throughout. These APMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to statutory measures. For more information on Genus’s APMs, see the APM Glossary.The effect of exchange rate movements on the translation of our overseas profits was to reduce the Group’s adjusted profit before tax for the year by £6.3m compared with 2020, primarily due to weakness in Latin American currencies. All growth rates quoted are in constant currency unless otherwise stated. Constant currency percentage movements are calculated by restating the results for the year ended 30 June 2021 at the average exchange rates applied to adjusted operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2020. In the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group’s overall performance was very strong.

PIC’s revenue growth of 11% in constant currency (up 6% in actual currency) continued to be underpinned by China, as the strong pig price for much of the year supported growth in royalty revenue and breeding stock sales, as customers expanded production. In ABS, revenue was up 13% in constant currency (5% in actual currency) reflecting continuing success of our sexed and beef genetics, particularly across Brazil, Russia, India and China.

Profit before tax excluding SaaS impact’ is presented only this year to demonstrate the impact of our change in accounting policy, and will not be presented in future in the years.2 n/m = not meaningful.Adjusted operating profit including joint ventures was £89.8m (2020 restated: £70.8m), reflecting a high growth rate of 36% in constant currency as mentioned above. Within this, Genus’s share of adjusted joint venture operating profit was higher at £13.0m (2020: £11.3m), primarily due to strong results in the PIC Agroceres joint venture in Brazil and our joint venture in China. Amounts attributable to non-controlling interests were lower at £0.1m (2020: £0.6m) due to lower third party royalty income and a ramp up in dairy product development within our De Novo joint venture. Our gene editing investment, which is primarily focused on creating resistance in pigs against the devastating PRRSv disease, increased £2.4m to £7.6m, largely because FY20 included net income of £3.2m from BCA, our Chinese partner. Excluding this, gene editing expenditures reduced through efficiencies gained from internalising our capability to produce gene edited animals. Adjusted operating profit including joint ventures and excluding gene editing investment increased by 37% in constant currency to £97.4m (2020 restated: £76.0m), which far exceeded our medium-term objective to achieve growth of 10%. The impact to profit from COVID-19 effects on trading across the Group were largely offset by short-term travel savings of approximately £5m compared to the prior year. 66.3Adjusted Operating Proﬁt including JVs excluding Gene Editing investment£m1009080607050FY17FY18FY19FY21FY20Adjusted operating proﬁtGene editing investmentABS GENETICS SALES VOLUMES TO US DAIRY FARMERS63.665.976.097.4PIC performed strongly, with adjusted operating profit including joint ventures up 16% in constant currency, particularly benefitting from continued strong demand in China. Volumes were up 11% (5% excluding China) with all regions contributing. Strategically important royalty revenues were up 11%, supported by strong growth in China of 121% and Europe of 11%. However North America declined 1%, due to some customers’ breeding activities being impacted by COVID-19 related packing plant slowdowns in the first half of the year and PRRSv disease outbreaks in the second half of the year.\f32Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021FINANCIAL REVIEW contInueDABS had a particularly strong year, with adjusted operating profit increasing 21% and record volume growth of 15%. Sexcel continued to demonstrate that it is the sexed product of choice for progressive dairy farmers, driving overall sexed volume growth of 29%. The growing use of NuEra beef genetics in dairy herds supported beef volume growth of 22%. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause challenges to our customers and adjusted operating profit growth was achieved in all regions except North America. Both Asia and Latin America achieved strong double-digit growth, with the latter continuing to benefit from innovative digital sales campaigns.Central costs were stable in constant currency at £20.0m (2020 restated: £20.8m). This included a one-time £500 award to every employee for recognition of their effort through the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as investments to design and start implementing a new target operating model for our global finance and procurement functions. Our GenusOne enterprise system roll-out continues to make good progress. As reported above, under new IFRIC guidance, the continuing costs to configure and implement the GenusOne cloud environment during the year of £2.7m (FY20: £5.2m) are now being expensed rather than capitalised, with FY20 also being restated. As these costs are one-off in nature, we have determined to keep them in Central, with the reduction over the prior year due to less configuration work as the roll-out progresses.STATUTORY PROFIT BEFORE TAXThe table below reconciles adjusted profit before tax to statutory profit before tax:2021£mrestated2020£mAdjusted Profit Before Tax84.865.8Operating profit attributable to non-controlling interest0.10.6Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets in JVs and associates3.1(0.1)Tax on JVs and associates(3.0)(2.3)Adjusting items:Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets(10.8)15.8Amortisation of acquired intangible assets(7.4)(8.5)Share-based payment expense(7.7)(5.8)Exceptional items(3.3)(19.2)Statutory Profit Before Tax55.846.3Our statutory profit before tax was £55.8m (2020 restated: £46.3m), largely reflecting the increase in the underlying trading performance and the reduction in exceptional items, partially offset by the non-cash fair value net IAS 41 biological asset movement. Within this, there was a £6.4m uplift (2020: £13.2m uplift) in porcine biological assets and a £17.2m reduction (2020: £2.6m uplift) in bovine biological assets, due to certain fair value model estimate changes. Share-based payment expense was £7.7m (2020: £5.8m). These reconciling items are primarily non-cash, can be volatile and do not correlate to the underlying trading performance in the year.EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS There was a £3.3m net exceptional expense in the year (2020: £19.2m expense), which included legal fees of £2.5m (2020: £5.6m) and with the prior year also being impacted by £10.8m of damages and costs in relation to Genus ABS’s litigation with STGenetics. A non-cash Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’) equalisation charge of £2.3m in respect of pension schemes has also been recognised due to a High Court ruling on 20 November 2020, which ruled individual transfer payments made by UK pension schemes since 17 May 1990 need to be equalised for the effects of GMP. Also included is a credit of £2.0m in relation to a share forfeiture exercise.NET FINANCE COSTSNet finance costs were unchanged at £5.0m (2020: £5.0m). Average facility borrowings were comparable year on year, with reductions in market interest rates being largely offset by increased bank margins in relation to the Group’s new Facility Agreement, which was executed in August 2020, as well as higher commitment and utilisation fees. Amortisation costs in the year included £0.2m written off in respect of the previous facility, at the commencement of the new Facility Agreement, and £0.3m from the higher monthly amortisation costs of the new facility which are being spread over a shorter three-year duration.Other interest included £0.8m (2020: £1.0m) of IFRS 16 finance lease interest and £0.9m (2020: £0.9m) relating to the unwind of discount interest on the Group’s pension liabilities and put options. TAXATIONThe tax charge on the statutory profit in the year of £12.0m  (2020: £12.9m) represented an effective tax rate (‘ETR’) of 20.4% (2020 restated: 26.5%) with the prior year from 24.0% as a consequence of the SaaS accounting restatement. This prior  year increase was due to non-recognition of the related  deferred tax asset, as the losses created were considered  not to be utilisable on a timely basis. The statutory tax charge reduced by 3.6% due to the revaluation (from 19% to 25%) of deferred tax assets expected to crystallise post April 2022 in the UK and further reduced by 2.0% for additional future utilisation of previously incurred losses, particularly in Germany which has an improved trading and profitability outlook. These credits were offset by movements in tax provisions of 1.2% and a charge for prior year tax expenses  of 0.5%.The tax charge on adjusted profits in the year was £19.1m (2020: £15.6m), which represented a tax rate of 22.5% (2020 restated: 23.7%). The adjusted tax rate is reduced by 3.3% by the revaluation of UK deferred tax assets previously mentioned, offset by a charge of 0.8% primarily resulting from the provision for State Aid on CFC Finance Companies. In March 2021, HMRC issued Genus with a charging notice for £1.2m in respect of its assessment of the state aid due to be recovered. During the year, Genus has provided a further £0.4m (2020: £1.0m) in respect of its exposure to the repayment of previously claimed tax benefits under this State Aid challenge but will continue to pursue various avenues of appeal against both the EU Commission’s original decision and HMRC’s interpretation of that decision,  as calculated in the charging notice received.The outlook for the Group ETR is in the range of 23%–25%, consistent with the current year, excluding the one-off change of rate benefit and provision increase. EARNINGS PER SHAREAdjusted basic earnings per share increased by 31% (40% in constant currency) to 100.9 pence (2020 restated: 77.3 pence)  as a result of the strong trading performance and lower tax rate. Basic earnings per share on a statutory basis were 72.6 pence (2020 restated: 54.4 pence), reflecting the strong trading performance and lower exceptional charges, partially offset by the non-cash fair value net IAS 41 biological asset movement.BIOLOGICAL ASSETS A feature of the Group’s net assets is its substantial investment  in biological assets, which under IAS 41 are stated at fair value.  At 30 June 2021, the carrying value of biological assets was £337.3m (2020: £370.2m), as set out in the table on the next page.\f33STRATEGIC REPORT2021£m2020£mNon-current assets279.9310.1Current assets39.639.8Inventory17.820.3337.3370.2Represented by:Porcine227.4242.7Dairy and beef109.9127.5337.3370.2The movement in the overall balance sheet carrying value of biological assets of £32.9m includes the effect of exchange rate translation decreases of £35.3m. Excluding the translation effect there was: >a £9.1m increase in the carrying value of porcine biological assets, due principally to an increase in the number of animals held, as well as to the mix of animals held; and >a £6.7m reduction in the bovine biological assets carrying value, primarily due to current estimates, based on market data, of the semen sales price attributable to the biological asset value. The historical cost of these assets, less depreciation, was £65.1m at 30 June 2021 (2020: £57.5m), which is the basis used for the adjusted results. The historical cost depreciation of these assets included in adjusted results was £10.0m (2020: £11.0m).RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONSThe Group’s retirement benefit obligations at 30 June 2021 were £11.1m (2020: £18.1m) before tax and £9.0m (2020: £14.6m) net of related deferred tax. The largest element of this liability now relates to some legacy unfunded pension commitments dating prior to the acquisition of PIC by Genus.During the year, contributions payable in respect of the Group’s defined benefit schemes amounted to £7.4m (2020: £8.4m). Contributions to the Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’) are scheduled to finish in September 2021 which will reduce the amounts payable going forwards. As the impact of COVID-19 on asset valuations reduced, robust investment strategies and higher bond yields during the year for our two main defined benefit obligation schemes have led to strengthened financial positions. Both the Dalgety Pension Fund and our share of the MPF reported IAS 19 surpluses, prior to any IFRIC 14 amendments, despite an additional GMP equalisation charge of £2.3m. CASH FLOWCash generated by operations of £86.6m (2020 restated: £77.2m) represented cash conversion of 113% (2020 restated: 128%) of adjusted operating profit excluding joint ventures. The strong conversion of adjusted operating profit to cash is aligned to  our medium-term objective to achieve conversion of at least  90%. The increase in cash generation was primarily due to the strong trading performance and a continued focus on working capital management. Capital expenditure cash flows of £33.8m (2020 restated: £29.7m) included continued investment in the ABS supply chain, with state-of-the-art new bull housing in Wisconsin, increasing PIC’s supply chain capacity, with a new genetic nucleus farm being constructed in Canada, and investment in software development. Cash inflows from joint ventures were higher at £3.7m (2020: £3.7m). After interest and tax paid, total free cash flow was £37.5m (2020: £35.2m).The cash outflow from investments was £16.9m (2020: £0.1m). This included an upfront payment of £6.9m as part of the £7.7m consideration to acquire the trade and assets of Sergal, a leading Spanish porcine semen distributor, £2.4m to acquire a 39% minority shareholding in Xelect, an aquaculture genetics services company, and deferred consideration payments from previous acquisitions of £6.7m. The net cash inflow after investments and dividends was £1.2m (2020: £16.9m), reflecting the additional investments and deferred consideration payments made during the year.Cash flow (before debt repayments)2021£mrestated 2020£mCash generated by operations86.677.2Interest and tax paid (19.1)(17.1)Capital expenditure(33.8)(29.7)Cash received from JVs3.73.7Other0.11.1Free cash flow37.535.2Acquisitions and investments(16.9)(0.1)Dividends(19.5)(18.3)Share issued0.10.1Net cash inflow (before debt repayments)1.216.9NET DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIESNet debt increased slightly to £105.6m at 30 June 2021 (2020: £102.6m) primarily due to new financing leases. At the end of June 2021 there was substantial headroom of £130m under the Group’s renewed credit facilities of £240m. The new facility was originally for a three-year term to 24 August 2023, but the Group exercised the first of two available extension options, extending the maturity date to 24 August 2024. The facility also includes an uncommitted £100m accordion option, which can be requested on a maximum of three occasions over the lifetime of the facility to fund the Group’s business development plans.The Group’s financial position and borrowing ratios remain very robust, with sufficient cash flows available to fund internal investments and sufficient debt finance available to pursue acquisition opportunities. At the end of June 2021, interest cover was at 45 times (2020: 35 times). EBITDA, as calculated under our financing facilities, includes cash received from joint ventures. Net debt as calculated under our financing facilities excludes IFRS 16 lease liabilities up to a cap of £30m but includes bank guarantees. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA on this basis at the year-end has remained stable at 0.9 times (2020 restated1: 0.8 times). This level of leverage is just below our medium-term objective of having a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of between 1.0 – 2.0 times.RETURN ON ADJUSTED INVESTED CAPITAL We measure the Group’s return on adjusted invested capital using adjusted operating profit including joint ventures after tax, divided by the operating net assets of the business on the historical cost basis and excluding net debt and pension liabilities. This removes the impact of IAS 41 fair value accounting, the related deferred tax and goodwill. The post-tax return on adjusted invested capital was higher at 23.0% (2020 restated: 20.1%), reflecting the strong profit growth and lower tax rate. This was partially offset by an increased asset base from the capital investments in supply chain capacity and the increased values of our Brazilian joint venture, Agroceres, and our Caribou shareholding.DIVIDEND Recognising the importance of balancing our investment for  the future with ensuring an attractive return for shareholders, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 21.7 pence per ordinary share, an increase of 10% over the prior year final dividend. When combined with the interim dividend increase of 10%, this will result in a total dividend for the year of 32.0 pence per ordinary share (2020: 29.1 pence per share), an increase of 10% for the year. Dividend cover from adjusted earnings remains strong at 3.2  times (2020 restated: 2.7 times), slightly above the medium-term target of an adjusted earnings cover range of 2.5 to 3.0 times.Alison HenriksenChief Financial Officer8 September 20211 FY20 Net Debt to EBITDA has been restated to reflect the revised credit facility terms completed in August 2020.\f34Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021Genus employs over 3,400 colleagues in 24 countries. We provide more information on our workforce in the Governance section. INCREASING INCLUSION We aim to be a ‘People Magnet’ for current and prospective colleagues, whoever and wherever they are. We nurture an open, respectful and supportive working environment, founded on the five company values our people helped to shape. We have established a range of global policies to help us, for example on Anti-Harassment and Diversity & Inclusion. We embed their provisions into our employee handbook and working practices, from recruitment assessments to onboarding activities, and from performance management to employee development. Additional activities include the work of AWAKE to enhance gender inclusion (discussed on pages 36 to 37). This year, we also delivered ‘unconscious bias’ training to over 100 senior leaders, helping them ensure current and future employees, customers and other stakeholders feel valued and respected, regardless of differences. Our recruitment programmes have subsequently sourced and considered a more diverse range of applicants. ATTRACTING NEW TALENT Internships and graduate programmes continued to bring new talent into Genus. For example, in the US, ABS brought in 28 interns (including 19 women) with three already progressing into full-time roles. In the UK, we recruited ten graduates, including four women. We also developed a new online recruitment and onboarding portal, to help us reach a broader and more diverse pool of candidates. We are currently rolling this out. DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLEWe give all employees opportunities to grow and thrive. For instance, we continue to evolve development programmes for people leaders at different levels, involving 212 participants from 14 countries (34% of whom were women, in line with our wider workforce profile). This year, steps included expanding training for first-time supervisors and piloting a new course for mid- to senior-level managers who have graduated from previous programmes and are keen to keep improving leadership skills. We implemented a ‘self nomination’ option for many development programmes, to help mitigate unconscious biases in delegate selection processes. We also enhanced diversity in succession plans by ensuring women have sufficient opportunities to develop the capabilities needed for future roles. In PIC Latin America, for example, three women were promoted in FY21, compared to only one during FY20.We also ensure that colleagues receive training on global policies. For example, every employee must complete annual training on our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and achieve 100% in a post-training test. Employees also complete annual training on animal well-being, anti-harassment and cyber security. Colleagues working directly with animals receive role-specific safety training. ENHANCING ENGAGEMENT We maintained our focus on engaging employees, despite constraints created by COVID-19. We regularly shared information on Company plans and progress, and enhanced leadership engagement through virtual global, regional and local town halls, plus CEO breakfasts with cross-sections of colleagues.Our two Non-Executive Director ‘employee representatives’ – Lesley Knox and Lykele van der Broek – held a breakfast discussion with employees from PIC Europe, gaining workplace and cultural insights to bring back to the Board. They will be holding further discussions around the world as COVID-19 restrictions are relaxed.ATTRACTINGBY BeInG A people MAGnetPEOPLE AND CULTUREANGELLE ROSATAGROUP HR DIRECTORWe nurture an open, respectful and supportive working environment founded on the five company values of Customer Centric, Results Driven, Pioneering, People Focused,  and Responsible.\f35STRATEGIC REPORTM = Male 57%F = Female 43%BOARD GENDER BREAKDOWNMFFY21FY202.612.05RECORDABLE INJURY FREQUENCYRATES PER 200,000 HOURS WORKEDM = Male 62%F = Female 38%GELT GENDER BREAKDOWNMFM = Male 66%F = Female 34%WORKFORCE GENDER BREAKDOWNMFThroughout the pandemic, our people have demonstrated great commitment, collaboration and resilience to help each other,  serve customers and support  their local communities. This has been facilitated by our focus on health and safety, flexible and remote working, and use of digital technologies. As highlighted opposite, our priority has been (and remains) the well-being of employees, their families and our customers. We have monitored and followed local public health guidance in every country where we operate, while local teams have worked together on additional steps to strengthen protections such as staggering break times and using white boards to communicate handovers at shift-changes rather than face-to-face meetings. Our investment in digital tools has enabled colleagues and teams to work together seamlessly, irrespective of location. For example, the team leading deployment of the new microfluidic chip for our IntelliGen technology replaced in-person visits to sites around the world with videos, online training and Microsoft Teams calls. Tools like Teams and Yammer have also helped colleagues remain connected and avoid isolation when working remotely.We have also embraced digital tools and platforms to communicate with customers, e.g. through a programme of webinars and highly-successful digital sales drives in Latin America. These efforts have been underpinned by a tremendous global team spirit and commitment to colleagues, customers and animals. Examples include employees covering different roles when colleagues have been self-isolating and export teams finding creative ways of continuing shipments of animals to customers, despite the challenges and complexities created by COVID-19. The effectiveness of our approach was recognised in a recent ‘pulse’ survey of more than 500 employees. 82% were proud of the way Genus had handled its response to the pandemic, 88% said they have the technology/tools needed to do their job and 87% knew who to talk to if they needed support. HOW WE’VE WORKED TOGETHER DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMICWe run a global employee survey every two years and ‘pulse’ surveys with smaller groups in between. Our ‘pulse’ survey this year gained input from nearly a quarter of employees. 74% of those surveyed responded favourably to ‘I would recommend a friend to work at Genus’, maintaining our employee Net Promoter Score (‘eNPS’) despite the challenges created by COVID-19. 82% of respondents said they were proud of the way Genus handled its response to the pandemic.IMPROVING HEALTH AND SAFETYThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been the safety of colleagues and their families. We introduced protective protocols for employees working at production facilities, in labs and with customers. We suspended overseas business travel and established rigorous guidelines, aligned with local public health authorities, for employees working in offices. In addition, we introduced support for mental health and well-being, recognising the pandemic’s impact on employees’ work and home lives. This included a ‘Well-being Week’, involving 25 webinars from experts in different aspects of mental health. We also gave employees access to more than 60 local well-being guides. Overall, we continued to improve health and safety performance, reducing the recordable injury frequency rate by 21.46% and vehicle incident rates by 16.9%.ACTING ON CONCERNSThere are many ways in which employees can raise issues, including an independent hotline that supports our Whistleblowing Policy and allows employees to anonymously report any concerns about unethical behaviour. Any such reports are immediately referred to the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. They are investigated and discussed with the Group HR Director, Head of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the Company’s Audit & Risk Committee. This process is regularly reviewed as part of our annual Audit & Risk Committee activity. Five issues were reported during the year. Following full investigation, steps taken ranged from further training on relevant policies to disciplinary action. HUMAN RIGHTSGenus is committed to respecting the human rights of workers throughout our value chain and the local communities in which we operate. We aim to ensure that anyone who might be affected by Genus can enjoy the human rights described in the International Bill of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.We monitor this through the same process outlined above and there were no issues identified during the year.\f36Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021ADVANCINGWoMen’s ADVocAcY,  KnoWleDGe AnD eMpoWeRMentPEOPLE AND CULTURE CASE STUDY\fWOMEN ACHIEVING PROMOTION37STRATEGIC REPORTAWAKE (Advancing Women’s Advocacy, Knowledge and Empowerment) is an employee resource group working with executive sponsors, business leaders and colleagues across the Company to help us increase gender balance and develop more diverse teams more broadly. AWAKE has established a global community through which women connect, collaborate and participate  in development programmes. The group has a Company-wide leadership team, regional champions, 327 members and  141 male allies. The group communicates with leaders regularly and engages employees through webinars, newsletters, Yammer discussions and a SharePoint resource hub. In May 2021, AWAKE piloted training focused on leadership for women. AWAKE is one of the initiatives helping us increase representation of women in Genus. During the year, 100 women achieved promotion (44% of all promotions during the year) and 37 women made lateral moves to take on new roles and responsibilities (46% of all such moves during the year). AWAKE has also established a firm foundation for further initiatives to increase diversity in all its forms across our Company. 100\f38Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021Sustainability lies at the heart of our business. It informs our purpose of pioneering animal genetic improvement to help nourish the world and infuses the core values that shape our work, every day.We make a positive contribution to the world around us. According to the UN, the global population is almost 8 billion people today and is projected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050. Our genetic improvement work is directly focused on helping farmers to meet the challenge of producing meat and milk more efficiently and sustainably, increasing the availability of high-quality, affordable animal protein around the world. This challenge is exacerbated by global climate change, and risks to food security which flow from it. As a result of bovine and porcine genetic improvement, our customers use far less land, water and other natural resources to produce more milk or meat than they did some decades ago. We are therefore helping to nourish the world whilst reducing the impact agriculture has on the environment and we continue to accelerate our genetic improvement programmes as we aim to lead the market in sustainable animal protein production.In parallel, we continue to reduce the environmental impact of our own operations, guided by our Climate Change Policy. This policy, which is available on the Company’s website, commits us to a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions by 2030 and becoming a net-zero emissions business by 2050. We will use the primary intensity ratio to report emission reductions, and we have a range of practical activities already underway  to help us achieve this.We fulfil our commitment by challenging ourselves and those around us to think differently. From small improvements in working practices to innovations that address stakeholder needs, we constantly develop and explore new ideas for enhancing our contribution and delivering positive, sustainable change. During the year, we reviewed our governance to ensure that sustainability issues are receiving focus at the highest levels of our organisation. From FY22, the composition of our Sustainability Committee will be bolstered by the addition of the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Scientific Officer and the Chief Operating Officers of our business divisions as members. The Committee will also be attended by Lysanne Gray, our Non-Executive sustainability champion, and the Committee’s activities will be reported directly to the Board of Directors, ensuring that oversight of sustainability is a matter for the Board as a whole. We translate our bold thinking into policies and practices that underpin our operations around the world. From core principles on protecting animal well-being to guidelines on supporting community causes, we articulate expectations, provide information and deliver training where needed to ingrain responsible business practices across our organisation and the people we work with.We set and continually monitor progress using key performance indicators (see page 41). We also ensure employees  have multiple routes to raise any concerns (including the independent whistleblowing hotline explained earlier). No material issues were reported during the year.SUSTAINABILITYAt tHe HeARt oF ouR BusInessSUSTAINABILITY REPORTOur genetic improvement work is directly focused on helping farmers to meet  the challenge of producing meat and milk more efficiently and sustainably.\f39STRATEGIC REPORTWE RAN A UK TRIAL INVOLVING 149 CALVES FROM SIX SIRES, WHICH DEMONSTRATED STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN GENETIC QUALITY AND GHGS1%1210264801.001.051.101.151.201.25Proﬁt Max SiresStandard SiresDaily weight gain (kg meat/day)ENHANCING OUR NUERA PROFIT INDEX IN THE UKBy adding feed efficiency as a selection trait, Genus ABS is using market-focused performance data to drive efficiency and sustainability for customers. The results of a recent UK trial involving 149 calves from six sires shows a strong correlation between genetic quality and GHGs, with reduction improvement of 11% for the highest genetic level per kilogram of meat.ENERGY USE AT LEEDS:  MOVING FROM ‘BROWN TO GREEN’ As part of a long-term plan to expand  its production capacity in North America, ABS is building new production facilities and laboratories at Leeds, Wisconsin.  Due to its reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation, the state of Wisconsin has one of the highest electricity grid carbon intensity figures in the US, so to support Genus’s ambitions for decarbonisation, the Company is installing photovoltaic panels at the site which will supply 377 kW of DC energy and remove pressure on the local power grid. DECARBONISING TRANSPORT –  FLEET TRANSFORMATION PLAN Travel in vehicles represents around 14% of our carbon footprint. As we prepare for governments to cease sales of petrol and diesel vehicles we are assessing the differences between standard diesel van and battery electric vehicles.  During the year Genus operated six fully electric vehicles in its UK fleet and has plans to increase to 15 in FY22 as part of a ‘fleetwide’ replacement programme. From FY22, the Company will cease to buy any petrol or diesel-only vehicles in the UK, and we are working with suppliers to solve issues for employees, such as access to charging points at home. 1 Based on Genus UK trial with strategic customer; data represents average performance of 149 offspring of six Genus British Blue sires processed in 2019 and 2020;  percentage improvement represents reduction in carbon dicoxide equivalents (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) per kilogram of carcass, relative to worst performing sire in trial.\f40Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTSUSTAINABILITY REPORT contInueDPROGRESSING OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGYOur Sustainability Committee contains experts from around our global Company.

Genus has committed to take action  on climate change in a number of ways, including: >driving porcine and bovine genetic improvements which support productivity gains and improve feed efficiency, enabling a reduction in the production of GHG emissions per unit of milk or meat produced; >reducing the carbon footprint of our own operations through developing a better understanding of how energy is used in our business. We are committed to the sustainable development of new facilities and are evaluating the use of renewable power solutions on a number of our farms; and >partner and advocate for policies that advance positive climate goals and identified United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’).OUR REPORTING APPROACHIn FY20 we refined our methods to measure GHG emissions and developed a Tier 2 FY19 emission baseline (‘FY19 Baseline’). Subject to restatement due  to collection of more accurate data,  the FY19 Baseline is used to measure future improvements. We are committed to reducing GHG emissions in our operations and will use the ‘primary intensity ratio’ to report emission reductions. We aim to reduce the primary intensity ratio by 25% by 2030 and to have net zero GHG emissions by 2050. This means that even as our business grows, we are seeking to  ensure that our GHG emissions shrink.We use operational control as our reporting approach. We have determined and reported the emissions we are responsible for within this boundary and believe there are no material omissions. As part of the review of Tier 2 methodology we include our share of joint venture emissions and omit some livestock held by third parties, due to our limited control over operating policies.GHG EMISSIONS REPORTING OUTCOMESOur GHG emissions are primarily methane produced by our animals, carbon dioxide from consuming fuel and other materials, and from transport.Our total GHG emissions decreased by 6.8% and primary intensity ratio decreased by 0.2%, driven down by a change in the age profile and balanced by an increase in the number of our animals resulting from the inclusion of third-party sites within the scope of our FY21 emissions reporting. In FY21 we have also applied more detailed assessments of our source data and reporting of emissions factors relating to animal feeds, and have restated our reported FY20 and FY19 numbers accordingly.ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGYWorld Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development ‘The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard’DEFRA ‘Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions’DEFRA ‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance’Emissions Factor Data SourceIPCC ‘Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories’DEFRA/DECC ‘Conversion Factors for Company Reporting’ Energy EfficiencyWe use significant volumes of energy to power our vehicles, buildings and equipment. Where we are not able to access low carbon sources of power, we use ‘high carbon’ fuels, including coal to heat our buildings. We have started to replace these with lower carbon alternatives or renewables. At our Benxi and Chunhua sites in China, we will cease use of coal in FY22 as we implement energy efficient replacement heating systems. At our Dekorra Campus in Wisconsin, we operate a solar PV energy system producing between 1.5–8.4 MwH energy per month and have invested in additional solar generation at our new site in Leeds, Wisconsin. We have continued to invest in and support our facilities teams over FY21 and have completed targeted energy efficiency audits at five ABS sites. Our R&D team have implemented awareness and schemes which target laboratory energy efficiency and waste which has led to a reduction in downstream carbon emissions in hazardous waste disposal. Whilst FY21 saw an overall reduction in ‘Scope 3’ related emissions from flying, we successfully implemented enterprise remote working and undertook essential travel in company cars. Overall, we have noted a 22% reduction in transport related emissions in FY21. Over this time, we have started to implement our fleet transformation plan. In FY21, we operated six electric and 35 hybrid vehicles in the UK and continued our focus on technology-based solutions and telematics to help our fleet drivers reduce their energy use and emissions. Genus Energy DataIn line with the UK Government’s energy and carbon reporting requirements, further information on our energy consumption for the last two years across Genus is set out opposite. This is sourced from data for the carbon data reported in this section and is tracked internally. All data is collected from metered data for electricity. Biogas combustion information is calculated using assumptions based on records in China and Brazil. Fuel use is reported based on financial records of fuel purchased. We have applied assumptions on standard calorific values to convert all liquid and gas fuel types to a common energy metric (kWh) and data is reported for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021.\f43STRATEGIC REPORTEmissions fromFY21Tonnes of CO2eFY20 (restated)Tonnes of CO2eFY19 (restated)Tonnes of CO2e%  change  from FY19 BaselineUK and offshoreGlobal (excluding UK and offshore)UK and offshoreGlobal (excluding UK and offshore)UK and offshoreGlobal (excluding UK and offshore)Scope 1 – combustion of fuel, own transport and livestock emissions2,62672,3142,63077,6733,17878,773-9%Scope 2 – purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling1306,6951686,8501717,268-8%Total Scope 1 and 22,75679,0092,79884,5233,34986,041-9%Scope 3 – material usage and waste, third-party distribution and business travel14,66416,11921,489-32%Total emissions96,429103,440110,879-13%Primary intensity measure – animal weight (tonne)9,83910,4889,5433%Secondary intensity measure – turnover (£m)574.3551.4488.518%Primary intensity ratio – Scope 1 and 2  (tCO2e/tonne animal weight)8.318.339.37-11%Secondary intensity ratio – Scope 1, 2 and 3 (tCO2e/turnover)167.9187.6226.9-26%Annual emissions figures have been calculated based on actual nine-month data for July to March for travel and distribution and ten-month data for July to April, with both extrapolated to full year.Energy TypeSourceUnitsFY21FY20 FY19% change from FY19 BaselineElectricityElectricity importedkWh15,309,57720,156,01017,599,380-13%Electricity generated from renewable sources and used on sitekWh384,012334,670303,80026%Electricity generated from renewables sources and exportedkWh000–Gas fuelsGas imported from the gridkWh10,876,0639,617,8024,491,962142%Liquid fuelsFuel used by plant (gas oil and diesel)kWh18,548,96418,268,08918,003,3803%TotalTotal energy used (i.e. annual quantity of energy consumed from activities for which the Company is responsible, including combustion of fuel and operation of facilities)kWh45,118,61648,376,57140,398,52212%Total energy imported (i.e. annual quantity of energy consumed resulting from the purchase of electricity and gas.

We therefore actively listen to our stakeholders at all levels of the organisation, to ensure we take account of and respond to their interests. Information on how we engage with our stakeholders, including the Board’s direct and indirect engagement with them, can be found on pages 12 to 13.The agenda for each Board meeting indicates the relevant stakeholder groups against each item, ensuring the Directors are aware of the stakeholder interests they need to consider in their decisions.STANDARDS OF BUSINESS CONDUCTThe Board is aware of the need to maintain high standards of business conduct. The Group has a strong ethical culture, underpinned by our values and policies, which are endorsed by the Board. The Group also has specific policies and procedures to prevent bribery and corruption, as described on page 34 and as made available on our website genusplc.com.SECTION 172 STATEMENTSection 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 imposes a general duty on every company director to act, in good faith, in the way they consider would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its shareholders. In doing so, directors must take into account a list of factors that include: >the likely long-term consequences of board decisions; >how the company’s actions and behaviours affect customers, employees, suppliers, the community and the environment; >the desirability of maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and >the need to act fairly between shareholders.This statement explains how the Board complies with its obligations under section 172.LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF BOARD DECISIONSGenus has a business model and strategy that deliver results on a multi-year basis. For example, we target customers where we can build long-term and mutually beneficial relationships, rather than seeking one-off transactions. Our investment in R&D can also take several years to result in revenue generating products, meaning our success in the short-term depends on long-term decisions taken in previous years. As a consequence, long-term decision making is a natural part of the Board’s approach.The table below, and the information it refers to, is intended to help stakeholders understand our position on key non-financial matters in line with the non-financial reporting requirements contained in Sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006.Reporting  requirementPolicies and standards which  govern our approachRisk management and  additional informationEnvironmental mattersSustainability FrameworkSee pages 38 to 41EmployeesGlobal Employee Handbook;See pages 34 to 37Whistleblower PolicyHuman rightsGlobal Employee Handbook;See page 35Whistleblower PolicySocial mattersCharitable Donations PolicySee pages 38 to 41Anti-corruption and anti-briberyAnti-Bribery and Corruption PolicySee pages 34 to 35Policy embedding, due diligence and outcomesGlobal Employee HandbookSee Strategic Report on pages 1 to 49Description of principal risks and impact  of business activityn/aSee Principal Risks and Uncertainties  on pages 46 to 48Description of the business modeln/aSee Business Model on pages 10 to 11Non-financial key performance indicatorsSustainability FrameworkSee page 41Maintaining high standards of business conduct also relies on having the right culture within the Group.

Lysanne Gray is the Board’s Sustainability Sponsor. She receives regular updates from the Sustainability Committee, which monitors progress against the five pillars of the Group’s sustainability framework including the actions identified in the Group’s Climate Change Policy.TREATING SHAREHOLDERS FAIRLYThe Company’s shares are owned by a wide range of institutional and individual shareholders, with no shareholder having a majority holding or significant influence over the Group. As a result, no situations arise in which any shareholders can be treated differently, ensuring fair treatment for all.\f45STRATEGIC REPORTKEY BOARD DECISIONSExamples of key Board decisions during the year, including how the Board considered the interests of relevant stakeholders, are set out below.DECISION 1BackgroundDuring the year, the Board approved two investments to enhance ABS’s facilities at Dekorra and Leeds in Wisconsin. This involved the construction of new bull housing at both locations and the building of an IntelliGen production facility at Leeds.Relevant Stakeholders and Their InterestsThe relevant stakeholders with interests in the proposal were: >customers, who were looking for ABS to have the capacity to support their needs, including the ability to meet their rapidly growing demand for sexed semen; >communities, in particular around our nearby DeForest site, where the growing town had begun to encroach on the facility; and >shareholders, given the investment was necessary to support our planned growth.The proposal also supported the welfare of the bulls themselves, by providing them with state-of-the art housing.Actions TakenThe first bull barn at Leeds, with capacity for 120 animals, was populated on 28 June 2021. A second barn at Leeds and the combined Sexcel and conventional laboratory will open in September 2021. Work on a further 40 spaces at Dekorra and a third barn and solar project at Leeds all started in July 2021.Likely Long-Term ConsequencesThe Board’s decisions to improve the two investments will support ABS’s ability to meet customer needs over the coming years and to generate growth and returns for shareholders in the process.DECISION 2BackgroundBio-security is fundamental to our business and therefore we’ve been ahead of the curve in our response to COVID-19.We were acutely aware of the potential impact and consequences of the pandemic and were therefore able to quickly respond, for example by restricting travel in and out of China ahead of advice from western governments.We continued to operate in a COVID-secure way for all employees at all locations, and did not require any government support.Relevant Stakeholders and Their InterestsEmployees and customers.Actions TakenCOVID-secure working arrangements were implemented across different sites, with offices moving to home working; production sites and laboratories operating with reduced staffing and staggered breaks; and changing advice for customer farm visits such as limiting face to face contact, maintaining social distancing and enhanced hygiene practices.We leveraged recent investments that had been made in IT meaning that our staff have been able to easily work from home, limiting the need to visit offices, customer contact has shifted towards remote teleworking, and limited or no travel has been taking place.There has been a global effort from the Health & Safety team to coordinate local health and safety advice, and the Company’s response in each country has been in line with local government guidance. During the year, a mental well-being week was rolled out, with 25 different webinars covering mental health awareness and self help and self care. The webinars, provided by expert advisers, were held across six countries ensuring local, culturally sympathetic perspectives were covered. Likely Long-Term ConsequencesThe business has continued to operate throughout the pandemic in a COVID-secure way, with no material business disruption for customers, and without furloughing any employees. Employees have generally responded that they have felt supported and enabled to continue to do their jobs throughout the pandemic.\f46Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021Genus is exposed to a wide range of risks and uncertainties as it fulfils its purpose of providing farmers with superior genetics, which in turn supports the fulfilment of its vision.Some of these risks relate to the current business operations in our global agricultural markets, while others relate to future commercial exploitation of our leading-edge R&D programmes. We are also exposed to global economic and political risks such as trade restrictions. As part of our risk management process we monitor emerging risks and consider when to include them in our main risk assessment process. This year we updated our evaluation of two of our emerging risks. The first is changing consumption patterns and the emergence of alternative proteins such as lab-based meat. The second is our ability to continue to support sustainable protein production, while reducing the environmental impact of our own operations. We determined that sustainability has become a principal risk due to the growing global focus on climate change and is explained further opposite. Additionally, due to the improved funding position of our pension plans, we no longer consider pension funding a principal risk. ROBUSTAppRoAcH to RIsKPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESIn considering our risks during the year, we also performed detailed assessments of the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and Brexit. The assessment covered the impact of these two risks on our people, our customers and our supply chain. We also assessed the short- and long-term risks associated with the expected global economic disruption affecting our industry and the markets where we operate. Whilst we continue to evaluate the impact of these two risks, our assessment is that they are not principal risks for Genus.From our broad risk universe, we have identified ten principal risks, which we regularly evaluate based on an assessment of the likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of potential impact, together with the effectiveness of our risk mitigation controls.The Directors confirm that they have undertaken a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties facing the Group. More information on our risk management framework can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 56.LINK TO STRATEGYDelivering a differentiated  proprietary genetic offeringFocusing on large and progressive protein producers globallySharing in the value deliveredConsidered for Viability AssessmentRead more on p.16 – p.17Risk item focused on sustainability\f47STRATEGIC REPORTRiskRisk descriptionHow we manage riskRisk change in 2021Strategic RisksDEVELOPING PRODUCTS WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGESTRATEGIC LINK   >Development programmes fail to produce best genetics for customers. >Increased competition to secure elite genetics.Dedicated teams align our product development to customer requirements. We use large-scale data and advanced genomic analysis to ensure we meet our breeding goals. We frequently measure our performance against competitors in customers’ systems, to ensure the value added by our genetics remains competitive.No change.CONTINUING TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP INTELLIGEN TECHNOLOGYSTRATEGIC LINK  >Failure to manage the technical, production and financial risks associated with the rapid development of the IntelliGen business.Our continued development of the technology and its deployment to new markets is supported by dedicated internal resources and agreements with suppliers.Further patent infringement proceedings initiated by ST in the US are being vigorously defended.No change. We continue to improve our technology and to innovate, enhancing fertility outcomes and processing efficiency, with the next generation of IntelliGen, Gen2 recently launched. We also continue to increase IntelliGen’s global deployment, securing new third-party customers.DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALISING GENE EDITING AND OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGIESSTRATEGIC LINK   >Failure to develop successfully and commercialise gene- editing technologies due to technical, intellectual property (‘IP’), market, regulatory or financial barriers. >Competitors secure ‘game- changing’ new technology.We stay aware of new technology opportunities through a wide network of academic and industry contacts. Our Genus Portfolio Steering Committee oversees our research, ensures we correctly prioritise our R&D investments and assesses the adequacy of resources and the relevant IP landscapes. We have formal collaboration agreements with key partners, to ensure responsible exploration and development of technologies and the protection of IP. The Board is updated regularly on key development projects.No change. Key initiatives continue to progress through  the R&D lifecycle, and we maintain the high level of investment needed to bring  the end products to market.CAPTURING VALUE THROUGH ACQUISITIONSSTRATEGIC LINK    >Failure to identify appropriate investment opportunities or to perform sound due diligence. >Failure to successfully integrate an acquired business.We have a rigorous acquisition analysis and due diligence process, with the Board reviewing and signing off all material projects. We also have a structured  post-acquisition integration planning  and execution process.No change. We continue to work diligently to identify areas of opportunity consistent with our strategic plans and our aim to accelerate growth and create value for our shareholders.Our experiences with post-acquisition integration provide a platform for integrating newly acquired businesses.GROWING IN EMERGING MARKETSSTRATEGIC LINK  >Failure to appropriately develop our business in China and other emerging markets.Our organisation blends local and expatriate executives, supported by the global species teams, to allow us to grow our business in key markets, while managing risks and ensuring we comply with our global standards. We also establish local partnerships where appropriate, to increase market access.Increased.This is due to market price volatility and uncertainty affecting production and profitability in the China pork market. SUSTAINABILITYSTRATEGIC LINK  >Failure to lead the market in sustainable animal protein production and help our customers to meet the challenge of producing meet and milk efficiently and sustainably. >Failure to fulfil our commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our own operations and implement our Climate Change Policy.We have a global sustainability strategy and climate change policy that are approved,  and regularly reviewed, at Board level.  Our Sustainability Committee oversees the implementation of the strategy and the annual objective setting process as well as monitors progress using key performance indicators. The Board is updated regularly  on the progress of the key initiatives and  our progress against the annual targets.New principal risk.There has been a substantial increase in consumer and investor focus on climate change during the year.\f48Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES contInueDRiskRisk descriptionHow we manage riskRisk change in 2021Operational RisksPROTECTING IPSTRATEGIC LINK   >Failure to protect our IP could mean Genus-developed genetic material, methods, systems and technology become freely available to third parties.We have a global, cross-functional process to identify and protect our IP. Our customer contracts and our selection of multipliers and joint venture partners include appropriate measures to protect our IP. We maintain IP appropriate landscape watches and where necessary conduct robust ‘freedom to operate’ searches, to identify third-party rights to technology.No change.ENSURING BIOSECURITY AND CONTINUITY OF SUPPLYSTRATEGIC LINK   >Loss of key livestock,  owing to disease outbreak.  >Loss of ability to move animals or semen freely (including across borders) due to disease outbreak, environmental incident or international trade sanctions and disputes. >Lower demand for our products, due to industry-wide disease outbreaks.We have stringent biosecurity standards, with independent reviews throughout the year to ensure compliance. We investigate biosecurity incidents, to ensure learning across the organisation. We regularly review the geographical diversity of our production facilities, to avoid over-reliance on single sites.Increased. This is due to the continued global supply chain challenges imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the continued spread of ASF, as well as the rising geopolitical tension. Our geographically diverse production facilities and the expert knowledge of our supply chain and commercial teams allowed for a swift and comprehensive response to these challenges, which helped to reduce their impact.HIRING AND RETAINING TALENTED PEOPLESTRATEGIC LINK   >Failure to attract, recruit, develop and retain the global talent needed to deliver our growth plans  and R&D programmes.We have a robust talent and succession planning process, including annual assessments of our global talent pool and active leadership development programmes. The Group’s reward and remuneration policies are reviewed regularly, to ensure their competitiveness. We work closely with several specialist recruitment agencies, to identify candidates with the skills we need.No change. We have been largely successful in recruiting and retaining the appropriate skills at all levels, to meet our business growth plans.Financial RisksMANAGING AGRICULTURAL MARKET AND COMMODITY PRICES VOLATILITYSTRATEGIC LINK  >Fluctuations in agricultural markets affect customer profitability and therefore demand for our products  and services. >Increase in our operating costs due to commodity pricing volatility. >The COVID-19 outbreak increased volatility and introduced significant new financial and operational pressure across agricultural markets.We continuously monitor markets and seek to balance our costs and resources in response to market demand. We actively monitor and update our hedging strategy to manage our exposure. Our porcine royalty model and extensive use of third-party multipliers mitigates the impact of cyclical price and/or cost changes in pig production.Increased. This is due to increased feed input costs as a result of higher grain prices, triggered by weather patterns and  strong demand. In addition, the China pork market continued to deal with the challenges of ASF, price decline and higher input costs. \f49STRATEGIC REPORTGOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENTIn assessing the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of preparing the financial statements as well as in assessing viability, the Board have taken into account: >Genus’s Strategic Plan which forms part of management’s best estimate of the future performance and position of the Group; >Genus’s risks and uncertainties including uncertainty arising from COVID-19 and its impact on our people, our customers and our critical business processes. Having now been through over a year of dealing with the risks and impacts of COVID-19, we believe that our mitigating controls have been largely successful and based on experience we do not expect new COVID-19 impacts that could not be largely mitigated. We therefore expect that the Group will remain resilient to the challenges of COVID-19; >Genus’s results at 30 June 2021 whereby the Group recorded adjusted profit before tax growth of 29% in actual currency; >Genus’s strong cash position at 30 June 2021 with free cash flow of £37.5m (2020: £35.2m) and net debt of £105.6m (2020: £102.6m) and had substantial headroom of £130m (2020: £125.4m) under the Group’s credit facilities of £240m;  >Genus’s credit facility agreement which consists of a £150m multi-currency RCF, a USD125m RCF and a USD20m and guarantee facility. The term of the facility was for three years, to August ’23, with an option to extend the maturity date before the first and second anniversaries of the signing date for a further year. In July ’21, we requested the first one year extension option and this was approved by all lenders in August ’21. The facility also includes an uncommitted £100m accordion option which can be requested on a maximum of three occasions over the lifetime of the facility to fund the Group’s business development plans; and >The potential use of mitigating actions including reduction in dividends and postponing certain capital spend and investments.As part of the Directors’ consideration of the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements, as well as their assessment of the Group’s viability, the Board considered a number of key factors, including our business model (see page 10), and our strategic framework (see page 16). In addition, all principal risks identified by the Group were considered in a downside scenario within the viability assessment with specific focus paid to those that could reasonably have a material impact within our outlook period, including:  >Growing in emerging markets, which we have modelled through reductions to short-term growth expectations, particularly in China;  >Developing products with competitive advantage, modelled through reductions to short-term growth expectations as a result of failing to produce best genetics for our customers or to secure elite genetics;  >Managing agricultural market and commodity prices volatility, modelled through reductions in price expectations, particularly in China; and >Ensuring biosecurity or continuity of supply, which is modelled through one-off impacts of disease outbreaks or border closures.We have considered the position if each of the identified principal risks materialised individually and where multiple risks occur in parallel. In addition, we have overlaid this downside scenario net of mitigating actions, with reverse stress tests on both our headroom and banking covenants to ensure the range above and beyond the downside scenario is fully assessed. Based on this assessment our headroom under these sensitivities and reverse stress tests, including our mitigating actions, remain adequate. In their assessment of the Group’s viability, the Directors have determined that a three-year time horizon, to June 2024, is an appropriate period to adopt. This was based on the Group’s visibility of its product development pipeline, for example, as a result of the genetic lag of approximately three years between the porcine nucleus herds and customers’ production systems and the pipeline of young bulls. The Board also considered the nature of the principal risks affecting Genus, including the agricultural markets in which it operates.Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future and for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt and consider appropriate the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report. Also, based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to June 2024. There are no indications from this assessment that change this expectation when looking beyond June 2024 at the Group’s longer-term prospects. The Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 8 September 2021 and signed on its behalf by:Stephen WilsonChief Executive8 September 2021Alison HenriksenChief Financial Officer8 September 2021\f50Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021PROVIDINGleADeRsHIp AnD oVeRsIGHtStrong corporate governance is the foundation for every successful business. A robust governance framework, combined with clear authorities and processes, allows the Board to set the executive team free to manage the business. At the same time, appropriate feedback loops enable the Board to oversee and support the implementation of strategy. During my first year at Genus, I have seen first hand that we have an effective Board, including strong Committee chairs and a group of Non-Executives with a wide range of necessary skills and experiences. The Board is ably supported by our Company Secretarial team, including clear meeting agendas that highlight the relevant stakeholder interests against each item we need to consider.The Executive Directors were both appointed to their roles in the previous financial year. Stephen Wilson is providing the forward-thinking leadership that a business such as Genus needs. I want to note here how well Alison Henriksen has settled in to Genus. She is bringing her own approach to reporting and the operation of the finance function, ensuring we achieve the planned benefits from our investment in GenusOne, developing a new target operating model for finance and helping to ensure we leverage the benefits of our scale, for example by creating a single procurement function. This work will ensure we take a consistent approach around the world, while improving our efficiency and simplifying the integration of any future acquisitions we might make.CHAIRMAN’S LETTERDuring my first year at Genus, I have seen first hand that we have an effective Board.IAIN FERGUSON\f51CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe Board’s capabilities were reflected in the performance evaluation during the year, which showed that the Board’s strengths remain consistent with prior years, and identified areas for further development. The ongoing pandemic has required the Board, and many of our colleagues across the Group, to work remotely during the year. I am pleased to say that the Group’s robust controls, coupled with prior investments in technology such as Microsoft Teams, has meant this has not compromised our governance structures.Looking forward, the Board is cognisant of the current geopolitical challenges and the need to maintain appropriate governance structures in markets where the Group has sizeable and growing businesses. This will remain an area of focus for the Board in the coming years.Iain Ferguson CBENon-Executive Chairman8 September 2021KEY GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIESThe Board’s key governance activities during the year have included:BOARD EVALUATION The Board undertook its annual performance evaluation, reviewed progress against prior year objectives and identified priorities for FY22Read more on p.60 – p.61UPDATING THE BOARD’S SKILLS MATRIXThe Board reviewed its skills matrix and identified its strengths and areas for improvement to consider through development and recruitmentRead more on p.64NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RECRUITMENTProfessor Jason Chin joined the Board in April 2021 following the retirement of Professor Ian CharlesRead more on p.62 – p.63CONTENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE50 Chairman’s Letter52 Board of Directors  and Company Secretary 54 Genus Executive Leadership Team56 Corporate Governance Statement56 The Board58 The Board’s Year in Review 62 Nomination Committee Report65 Audit & Risk Committee Report70 Directors’ Remuneration Report94 Directors’ Report96 Directors’ ResponsibilitiesSTATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 2018 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODEDuring the year ended 30 June 2021 Genus plc applied all the principles of the Code and has complied with all the provisions except for Provision 38. Provision 38 provides that Executive Director pension contribution rates should be in line with those available for the wider workforce. Our Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders on 14 November 2019, states that pension contribution rates for Executive Directors appointed after that date will be in line with rates available to the wider workforce. The pension contribution rate for Stephen Wilson was reduced at that time from 15% of base salary to 10% of base salary and will be discussed with shareholders as part of our next Remuneration Policy that will be tabled to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2022. \f52Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021LEADERSHIPIAIN FERGUSON CBENon-Executive ChairmanSTEPHEN WILSONChief ExecutiveALISON

It approves our strategy and corporate goals and monitors our performance against them; determines that we have the necessary resources, systems and controls to achieve our objectives; and sets the culture and standards of behaviour we want to see throughout Genus.The Board is also responsible for other critical decisions. These include approving the corporate budget; stress-testing our scenario planning to ensuring we have the right funding; approving material contracts, acquisitions, licences and investments; and reporting to shareholders.THE BOARD’S COMPOSITIONAt the year end, the Board comprised the Non-Executive Chairman, four independent Non-Executive Directors (‘NEDs’) and two Executive Directors – the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer. This gives a majority of NEDs on the Board.There were a number of changes to the Board’s composition during the year. More information can be found in the Chairman’s Letter on page 50.The Board comprises both well-established and newer NEDs, as we have broadened the Board’s skills and experience through Non-Executive appointments over recent years. As a result, the Board has an appropriate blend of different areas of expertise, long-standing knowledge of the Group and its markets, and fresher perspectives. This helps to ensure the Board provides even-handed oversight, works in a constructive and focused manner and has the capabilities to manage the challenges  of a complex and evolving global business environment.Almost all of our Directors have held leadership positions in international companies, with several having run businesses overseas. Several of our Directors, including the Chair of the  Audit & Risk Committee, have significant financial experience, while others have strong backgrounds in scientific research  or in leading science-based businesses.The Board believes that all of the NEDs are independent in character and judgement, and that there are no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect (or could appear to affect) their judgement. Following the performance evaluation described on page 60, the Board also confirms that all the Directors continue to be effective in their roles.As required by the Code, all the Directors will offer themselves for election at the next AGM. Details can be found in the Notice of AGM.BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESTo ensure we have clear responsibilities at the top of the Company, the Board has set out well-defined roles for the Chairman and Chief Executive. These, along with the responsibilities of our other Directors, are summarised in the table below.TitleIndividualResponsibilitiesCHAIRMAN IAIN FERGUSONIain’s primary responsibility is to lead the Board and ensure it operates effectively.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could not take place during the year. In addition to the Board meetings, the Board also holds an annual strategy session, focusing on the strategic direction and goals of the Group and its business units. This took place in January 2021.The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year. At each scheduled meeting, the Board receives updates on: >business performance, business development, talent development and competitive landscape developments from the Chief Executive; >financial performance of the business and forecasts from the Chief Financial Officer; and >corporate governance and legal issues from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, and external advisers.The table below provides more detail  of the Board’s discussions and activities, and the outcomes from them.

AnnuAl RepoRt 2021ASSESSING THE BOARD’S EFFECTIVENESSTo ensure the Board provides effective leadership to the Group, we have a three-year evaluation cycle, using a mixture of internal and external evaluations.The review showed that the Board is effective in most areas, is well led, and that the Directors challenge constructively and effectively. The review highlighted the following key strengths: >a diverse, inclusive and respectful culture; >high-calibre individuals, with a diverse range of experience; >a high level of trust and confidence in each other; >a culture that encourages constructive debate, whilst remaining collegiate; and >genuine interest in and passion for the business and its success.This was the third year of the current three-year cycle. In last year’s Annual Report, we noted the possibility of starting a new three-year cycle in FY21, following the appointment of a new Chairman. However, to allow Iain Ferguson a sufficient settling in period as Chairman, the Board decided to perform an internal review of the type described in year three of the cycle, with a view to conducting an external evaluation in FY22.The evaluation also identified the following priorities for the Board in FY21: >retaining a strong focus on outward-facing awareness; >supporting management as it navigates the post-COVID world; >ongoing Board succession; >bolstering experience in key geographies; and >focusing on ESG and sustainability.THE EVALUATION’S CONCLUSIONSYEAR 3An internal review using questionnaires and interviews with the Chair of the Board.YEAR 1An external Board effectiveness review produces an action plan for the areas of focus identified by the review.YEAR 2A follow-up questionnaire by the same external consultant enables us to monitor our progress with the focus areas.\f61CORPORATE GOVERNANCEBOARD FOCUS AREAS FOR FY21Last year’s evaluation identified four priorities for FY21. These priorities and the Board’s progress with addressing them are set out below:WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENTLykele van der Broek and Lesley Knox are the designated Workforce Engagement Directors.They continued to engage with employees this year, holding virtual meetings with PIC staff in the UK, Ireland, Russia, South Africa and Italy. The key points employees raised at town hall meetings are set out in the stakeholder engagement section on pages 12 to 13 of the Strategic Report. The Board will continue to monitor progress made against these points.Looking forward, the intention remains for the Workforce Engagement Directors to work around the Group’s different sites, to collect feedback and specifically to hold face-to-face meetings with employees as part of the Board’s programme of annual visits. While the ability to meet face-to-face will depend on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time, virtual meetings have continued to prove effective if site visits have not been possible.PURPOSE, CULTURE AND VALUES Genus has long been a purpose-driven business, as reflected in our vision of pioneering animal genetic improvement to help nourish the world. This purpose provides the bedrock for our strategy, with its rigorous focus on improving genetics for the benefit of progressive livestock farmers, and helping them to maximise their performance on their farms.To effectively deliver our strategy, and therefore to ultimately achieve our purpose, it is essential that we have the right culture, underpinned by a set of values that exemplify the business we want to be. These values – being customer centric, results driven, pioneering, people-focused and responsible – are completely aligned to both our purpose and our strategy. More information on our values can be found on page 9.Genus aims to maintain a positive, inclusive and cooperative culture, with a global outlook and a focus on excellent customer service. The Board has a number of ways of understanding and monitoring the culture around the business. In particular, these include the results of the Group’s Your Voice employee survey and the Workforce Engagement Directors’ interactions with employees during the year, as described above. The Board believes that health and safety performance is another important indicator of culture and the Directors monitor performance on a regular basis. During a typical year, the Directors also meet numerous people from around the Group, including members of management who present at Board meetings and through site visits, giving them further insight into the culture across the Group. Due to the COVID-19 related travel restrictions in FY21, the Board has used technology to hear voices from around the business. This has included customer presentations from Genus PIC and virtual site visits with the PIC leadership team, BQP and Hermitage, as well as customer presentations from Genus ABS and virtual site visits with the ABS leadership team and Arla. The Chief Executive and Workforce Engagement Directors also held employee breakfasts and town halls across the business (see page 59).More broadly, the Group’s performance process has a strong focus on behaviours that are aligned to our values, while succession planning at both Board level and below ensures that talent pipelines are diverse. The Board also ensures its own culture is aligned to the culture across the Group through the annual evaluations of the Board and its Committees.The Board is therefore satisfied that the Group’s culture is aligned with its purpose, values and strategy and that our workplace policies and practices are consistent with them.PriorityProgressSuccessful transition to the new Chairman and ongoing Board successionThe new Chairman has successfully transitioned into the role and his induction process continues. The appointment of NED Jason Chin in April 2021 reflects the focus on Board succession and his induction process is also ongoing. The Board continues to focus on Board succession planning more generally. Refer to the Nomination Committee Report on pages 62 to 64 for more information.Obtain greater insight into local and regional operating environments and markets, as a result of COVID-19Following the successful rollout of Genus One across North America, a more detailed and transparent view of each country is being provided to the Board.Retain the focus on leveraging value from R&DThe Board has focused on Gen2 of our IntelliGen technology. Jason Chin has attended the GSPC since his appointment.Ensure sufficient time is available to consider short- and long-term strategic topics and ‘out of the box’ thinkingGiven the impact of COVID-19 and the need to deal with the short-term consequences, this remains a focus area for the Board.\f62Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021Dear ShareholderThis continued to be a busy year for the Committee, as we focused on my successful transition as Chairman, the recruitment of a new NED, Jason Chin, and our ongoing induction process through a pandemic and related restrictions. The Committee also continued its broader work on succession planning, diversity and the mix of skills and experience on the Board.Iain Ferguson CBEChair of the Nomination Committee8 September 2021THE COMMITTEE’S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe Committee is responsible for: >making recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees; >evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity on the Board; >succession planning for the Non-Executive and Executive Directors and other senior executives; and >identifying and recommending suitable candidates to become Directors, based on merit.The Committee has written terms of reference, which set out the authority delegated to it by the Board. These are available from our website: www.genusplc.com.FOCUS AREAS FOR FY21In last year’s report, we identified two key focus areas for the Committee in FY21. These were: >to ensure a successful induction for Iain Ferguson; and >to continue proactive succession planning for key executive roles.Given the travel restrictions imposed due to COVID-19, the Chairman’s induction continues.THE COMMITTEE’S MAIN ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEARAppointment of Professor Jason ChinWe appointed Odgers Bernstson as the executive recruitment firm to conduct the search for a new NED. Odgers Bernstson has no other connections with the Group or with individual Directors. In conducting the search, we looked to identify a candidate with: >first-class academic credentials in life sciences; >a strong commercial edge, ideally at an organisation with significant R&D investment; >an active network in the international life sciences industry; >the ability to explain complex scientific concepts in lay terms; >the credibility to support and challenge the Chief Scientific Officer across technical topics; and >the right personality and fit.Experience in emerging markets was also seen as beneficial. From a longlist of candidates, we produced a shortlist for interview, with the result that we identified Jason Chin as the outstanding candidate. A summary of Jason’s work, roles and scientific credentials can be found in his biography on page 53.

During the year, the pandemic prevented travel and we therefore supplemented the induction programme with virtual meetings. Our induction programme has three main elements: >helping our Board members to conduct themselves effectively, through a governance course in London; >ensuring our Directors understand the legal and regulatory aspects of being a Board member; and >an introduction to our business, through meetings with our management teams and, when COVID-19 allows, sites visits.Induction for Iain FergusonIain joined the Board on 1 July 2020. The initial phase of his induction included: >introductory video calls with GELT members, attending a GELT meeting in person and in-person meetings with the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Group General Counsel and Company Secretary; >introductory video calls with Board members and attending the July 2020 and May 2021 Board meetings in person;  >virtual meetings with senior management across the businesses; >business presentations from Genus PIC; >business presentations from Genus ABS; >business presentations from Genus R&D; >virtual calls with material investors; and >calls with corporate advisers;Induction for Jason ChinJason joined the Board on 1 April 2021. The initial phase of his induction included: >introductory video calls with Board and GELT members and the Strategy and Business Development Director;  >attending the May 2021 Board meeting in person; and >virtual attendance at GPSC meetings.Ongoing induction activitiesIain and Jason travelled to our Stapeley and Ruthin sites at the end of July 2021, along with the rest of the Board. This included a tour of the barns and IntelliGen laboratory, a customer site visit and ABS business presentations.COVID-19 permitting, Iain and Jason are also scheduled to travel to the US in October 2021, to visit Pepsi Way, the Reproductive Biology Laboratory, the Genomics Laboratory, Dekorra and the nucleus herd, followed by visiting PIC’s site at Hendersonville.Both Iain and Jason are due to attend a governance course held by the Company’s advisers. SUCCESSION PLANNINGThe Committee has a formal three-phase succession planning process:AssessmentThe Committee reviews the Board’s current skills and experiences across a range of relevant areas. This results in a skills matrix (see page 64), which identifies the skills coverage across all Board members. Potential skills gaps are identified, so they can be incorporated into future succession planning at Board and Executive level. Areas for ongoing Board upskilling are identified and discussed. ApproachThe Committee applies engagement rules for succession planning, including:  >ensuring succession planning is in line with the Committee’s terms of reference; >considering the need to replace the skills of any departing NED; and  >filling any missing skills required for the Company’s strategic direction. Job specifications for the Non- Executives and Executives are kept up to date. ExecutionThe Committee identifies the desired skills for any new NED, for use in filling any future vacancies on the Board.Potential internal candidates for promotion to Executive Director are identified.\f64Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDBoard skills matrixThe table below shows the key experience and skills the Committee has identified as desirable and indicates their depth on the Genus Board.CompetenceLow/mediumGood/highBoard and corporate governance–100%Strategy–100%Finance, banking and capital markets43%57%Risk, culture change and change management–100%Politics and public affairs43%57%Stakeholder and customer communications14%86%Sustainability implementation and communications57%43%Human resources–100%IT systems, transformation and data/cyber security57%43%Science and biotechnology43%57%Food sector–100%Review, launch and marketing of fda regulated products86%14%International business14%86%US market28% 72%EMEA market28%72%Asian market43%57%LATAM market72%28%Succession planning for key executive rolesThe Committee has identified the need to focus on succession planning for key executive roles, and will make this a priority in FY22. DIVERSITYGenus shares the aspirations of the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reviews to promote greater representation of women and people from a minority ethnic background on company boards. At the year end, three of the seven Directors were female (43%), ahead of the 33% target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review. The Board will endeavour to retain the 33% target as a minimum. There were also three female members of GELT, comprising 38% of the total. The direct reports to GELT, excluding support staff, were 23% female and 77% male. Our Board diversity policy aims to ensure that we consider diversity in its broadest sense. A diverse Board has members with different skills, backgrounds, regional and industry experiences, races, genders and other qualities. The different viewpoints represented on a diverse Board can help Genus to maintain its competitive advantage. The Board is committed to building recruitment and leadership development programmes that capture inclusivity in our succession planning and talent development, including a focus on appropriate representation from female and minority ethnic candidates. The Group has an employee-led forum called AWAKE (Advancing Women’s Advocacy, Knowledge and Empowerment), which brings together female leaders and a cross-section of other women to develop ideas for increasing diversity and improving working practices.Diversity also links to our values, by being people-focused and responsible, and to our strategy by encouraging new ideas which deliver for our customers and ultimately drive our results.The Board, with the support of the Nomination Committee: >considers candidates against objective criteria and with regard to the benefits of Board diversity; >encourages the development of high-calibre employees, to create a pipeline of potential Executive Directors; >considers a wide pool of candidates for appointment as NEDs, including those with little company board experience; >ensures a significant portion of the longlist for NED positions are women and candidates from a minority ethnic background; and >only engages executive search firms which have signed up to the voluntary Code of Conduct on gender and ethnic diversity and best practice.The Board complied with the policy throughout the period. A copy of the policy can be found on our website: www.genusplc.com. The Committee reviewed the policy during the year and concluded that it remained appropriate. More information about diversity across Genus can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 34 to 37.SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENTCopies of service contracts and letters of appointment between the Directors and the Company will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours until the conclusion of the AGM on 24 November 2021, and at  the AGM from at least 15 minutes prior to the meeting until  its conclusion.COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS AND FOCUS AREAS FOR FY22As part of the Board evaluation process described on page 60, the Committee’s performance was reviewed. This identified areas of focus for the coming year, including talent development and Executive Director succession planning.\f65CORPORATE GOVERNANCEDear Shareholder The Audit & Risk Committee acts on behalf of the Board and shareholders, to ensure the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting, evaluate its system of risk management and internal control, and oversee the performance of the internal and external auditors. We have an annual work programme that is designed to deliver these commitments, which we followed during the year.On 1 May 2021, Ian Charles resigned, and Jason Chin was appointed. I was pleased to welcome Jason to the Committee and I would like to thank Ian for his significant contribution to the work of the Committee. The Committee’s membership continues to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and related guidance. All members are independent NEDs, who bring a sound range of financial, commercial and scientific expertise to the Committee.All members received regular updates from the external auditor, to ensure they continue to have current knowledge of the accounting and financial reporting standards relevant to the Group and the regulatory changes and revisions to auditing standards relevant to the provision of external audit services. We also kept up to date with developments in relation to the corporate governance requirements.Our focus on risk management continued throughout the year, with regular reviews and assessment of the Group’s existing and emerging risks. During the year we received and discussed detailed input from management on key risks and mitigation plans. In particular, we focused on the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact economies  and communities around the globe. We reviewed management’s assessment of the COVID-19 impact on internal financial controls and were satisfied these controls continued to operate as designed. We also continued to receive frequent updates on the ongoing implementation of a Group-wide enterprise system and monitor the development of its rollout. The system will further strengthen the control environment and support control standardisation across the Group.We have carefully considered the critical accounting policies and judgements and assessed the quality of disclosures and compliance with financial reporting standards, and reviewed the half-year and Annual Report, together with the related management and external audit reports. We also supported the Board in reviewing the going concern and viability statements and supporting analysis and disclosure.We have assessed the effectiveness of internal and external audit, and their use of technology and automated tools to perform audit work whilst observing the COVID-19 travel and office working restrictions. The Committee was satisfied with the performance of both the internal and external auditors. Our assessment identified opportunities to further enhance the audit services provided by sustaining the capabilities and efficiencies developed during the year.Lysanne GrayChair of the Audit & Risk Committee 8 September 2021MeetingsLysanne Gray (Chair)Ian Charles5/5Lysanne Gray5/5Bob Lawson3/3Lykele van der Broek5/5Stephen Wilson5/5Jason Chin1/1AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORTLYSANNE GRAYCHAIR OF THE AUDIT  & RISK COMMITTEE\f66Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021COMMITTEE COMPOSITIONThe Committee members’ biographies, along with information on Genus’s other Board members, can be found on  pages 52 to 53.The Board has confirmed that it is satisfied that Committee members possess an appropriate level of independence and relevant financial and commercial experience across various industries relevant to the Company.The Committee has formal terms of reference, approved by the Board, that comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code. These are available from our website: www.genusplc.com. The Committee’s annual review of these terms took place during the year.COMMITTEE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe Committee’s role and responsibilities include reviewing and monitoring: >the financial reporting process and any significant financial reporting judgements; >the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any formal announcements relating to financial performance; >the Annual Report, to ensure it is fair, balanced and understandable; >the Company’s reporting to shareholders; >the effectiveness of the Group’s accounting and financial reporting systems; >the effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls; >the effectiveness of the internal audit function; and >the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditor, including any non-audit services it provides to the Group.The Committee also: >ensures that the Group maintains suitable confidential arrangements for employees to raise concerns; and >reviews the Group’s systems and controls for preventing bribery.The Committee reports its findings to the Board, identifying any matters that require action or improvement, and making recommendations about the steps to be taken.COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESSEvery three years the Board appoints an external consultant to independently evaluate its performance, and that of its Committees. The last review was performed in 2019 and concluded that the Committee was effective in meeting its objectives. The next external evaluation will be in 2022.In 2021, the Committee assessed its own effectiveness, through a structured questionnaire, and concluded that it was effective. The Committee agreed to continue to enhance its effectiveness by further understanding and reviewing the adequacy of the Company’s systems for identifying and managing risk and assessing whether the Company has appropriate business continuity plans and whether the plans have been tested and maintaining an up-to-date understanding about the way our business is developing in Geopolitically challenged countries.THE COMMITTEE’S MAIN ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEARDuring the year, the Committee held five meetings and invited the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller, the Head of Risk Management and Internal Audit, and senior representatives of the external auditor to attend these meetings. The Committee also held separate private sessions during the year with the Head of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the external audit lead partner. At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following topics:Financial reportingThe main areas of focus and matters where the Committee specifically considered management’s judgements are set out below:AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDFinancial reporting areaJudgements and assumptions consideredINTANGIBLE ASSETSAs is set out in Note 2 Basis of Preparation the Company has changed its accounting policy related to the capitalisation of certain software assets; this change follows the IFRIC Interpretation Committee’s guidance publicised in May 2021 and relates to the capitalisation of costs of configuring or customising application software under ‘Software as a Service’ (‘SaaS’) arrangements. The Committee reviewed the nature of the costs proposed to be recognised in the Income Statement and is satisfied with the proposed accounting treatment, and adjustments made to restate the FY19  and FY20 financial statements, in line with the new accounting policy. This change in accounting policy led to adjustments amounting to an £8.1m and £13.3m reduction in the Intangible Assets recognised in the FY19 and FY20 Balance Sheets respectively, and to a £5.9m and £5.2m increase in Operating Expenses in those respective years. \f67CORPORATE GOVERNANCEFinancial reporting areaJudgements and assumptions consideredBIOLOGICAL ASSETS VALUATIONIn compliance with IAS 41, Genus records its biological assets at fair value in the Group Balance Sheet (£337.3m), with the net valuation movement shown in the Income Statement. The Committee has reviewed the methodology, which  has remained unchanged, and outcomes of the biological assets valuation. The Committee debated and considered management’s assumptions and estimates, through the current period, and discussed and reviewed the external auditor’s report on this area, before concurring with management’s proposals. The Committee also received updates on management’s streamlining and automation of the models which will be used for the valuation process. The Committee was satisfied with management’s accounting treatment, including the Income Statement increase of £6.4m in the value of porcine biological assets and the decrease of £17.2m in the value of bovine biological assets.GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENTThe Committee has reviewed the Group’s assessment of going concern over a period of 12 months and viability over a period of three years.In assessing viability, the Committee has considered the Group’s budget and strategic plan, its credit facility agreement, its principal risks and uncertainties including uncertainty arising from COVID-19, as detailed on pages 46 to 48, and the liquidity and capital projections over the period and is satisfied that this is appropriate in supporting the Group as a Going Concern.The Committee has concluded that the assumptions  are appropriate and that the viability statement could be provided, and advised the Board that three years was a suitable period of review. The Committee was also satisfied with the disclosures in relation to the appropriateness of the assessment period selected, the assumptions made and how the underlying analysis was performed. The going concern and viability statement is disclosed on page 49  of the report.PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL AND ADJUSTING ITEMSGenus had £29.2m of adjusting items, including £3.3m of exceptional items in the Group Income Statement. The Committee considered the presentation of these items in the financial statements, due to the nature of these items and the guidelines on the use of alternative performance measures, issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority. The Committee received detailed reports from management outlining the judgements applied in relation  to the disclosure of adjusting items, which include net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense and exceptional items. For adjusting items, the Committee took into consideration the improvements made concerning APM disclosures, their volatility and lack of correlation to the underlying progress and performance of the business. Specifically, for exceptional items, the Committee took into consideration the materiality, frequency and nature of the items. Following this detailed review and active discussion with management, the Committee has concluded that the presentation of the financial statements is appropriate.Monitoring business risksThe Committee discussed the principal risks identified with management and the external and internal auditors, along with management’s plans to mitigate them, and received regular detailed updates from the risk owners and their direct reports. In addition to reviewing the principal risks, the Committee received detailed updates on the following: >COVID-19: the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficiency of the mitigating controls implemented last year to support business operations and financial reporting process. >Climate change: the related current and emerging risks and the roadmap of actions identified in support of the climate change action plan. >Biosecurity and continuity of supply: the risk of losing key livestock or losing our ability to move animals and/or semen freely (including across borders), due to disease outbreak. >Enterprise system: the Committee received regular updates on the project to implement a new Group-wide business system. >Cyber security: the cyber security risk faced by the Group and the actions being taken to strengthen infrastructure and systems security.Internal control systemOur risk management process and system of internal control are described in detail on pages 68 to 69. The Committee reviewed the approach to standardising financial reporting controls as part of the new system implementation and the results of the key financial controls self-assessment process, which is performed every six months. The Committee also received an update on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related remote working and travel restrictions, on the operation of internal controls and was satisfied with how technology was being used to support remote working. The Committee further reviewed internal audit’s findings at each scheduled meeting and received updates on the implementation of management’s remedial actions.The Committee further reviewed the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy and bribery prevention procedures.\f68Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021The Committee conducted its annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and disclosures. The review did not identify any significant control failings. However, Genus routinely identifies and implements control improvement opportunities and the Committee discussed with management various opportunities to further strengthen the Group’s system of internal control.Oversight of internal audit and external auditInternal auditThe Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit function’s scope, terms of reference, resources and activities. The Committee reviewed the changes made to how internal audit activities were delivered, as result of travel restrictions and remote working requirements. The Committee was satisfied that the coverage and quality of internal audit process remained appropriate. The Head of Risk Management and Internal Audit provided regular reports to the Committee on the work undertaken and management’s responses to proposals made in the internal audit reports issued during the year. The Committee continued to meet the Head of Risk Management and Internal Audit without management being present. The Committee reviewed and was satisfied with the internal audit function’s performance.external auditDeloitte LLP was first appointed as the Company’s external auditor for the period ended 30 June 2006. Following a formal tender process, Deloitte was reappointed for the audit of the financial year ended 30 June 2016.In accordance with our current audit partner rotation timeline, the Committee expects to conduct an external audit tender for our FY25 audit. The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order for the financial year under review.The Committee reviewed and agreed the external auditor’s scope of work and fees, held detailed discussions of the results of its audit and continued to meet the external auditor without management being present. The Committee reviewed the external auditor’s objectivity and independence and the Group’s policy on engaging the external auditor to supply non-audit services. The Committee obtained confirmation that the Revised Ethical Standard has been complied with and received the details of the external auditor’s non-audit services to the Group, reviewed the nature and monetary levels of these services, which stood at 2% of audit fees, and reviewed compliance with the Group’s Non-Audit Services by Auditor Policy (see note 8 to the financial statements for further details). The Committee was satisfied that using Deloitte for such services did not impair its independence as the Group’s external auditor.The Committee assessed the external auditor’s performance in conducting the audit for the June 2020 year end, based on discussions with key finance staff and Committee members. The questionnaires covered the external auditor’s fulfilment of the audit plan, the auditor’s robustness and perceptiveness in its handling of key accounting and audit judgements, the content of the external auditor’s reports, and cost effectiveness. The Committee also considered the results of regulatory reviews performed on the external auditor. While noting some opportunities for further improvement, the Committee concluded that the external auditor was effective and was satisfied with the plan put forward by the external auditor to respond to the opportunities for improvement identified.RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLSRisk management The Board is responsible for our risk management system, which is designed to identify, evaluate and prioritise the risks and uncertainties we face. The Board sets our risk appetite, monitors the Group’s risk exposure for our principal risks and ensures appropriate executive ownership for all risks. This ongoing risk management process for the Group’s significant risks was in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. Our principal risks and how we mitigate them are summarised on pages 46 to 48.To further assist its understanding of risk, the Board continued its programme of visits to our local operations, prior to being interrupted by the COVID-19 travel restrictions. The Board received regular political, economic and industry risk updates from the relevant business groups. The Board performed its annual risk review in May 2021. This involved a fresh review of the types and levels of risk facing Genus as it executes its strategy and was designed to identify and evaluate any new or emerging risks and ascertain whether the risk register covered all relevant risks.Internal controlThe key elements of our internal control system are set out below. An internal control system cannot completely eliminate the risks we face or ensure we do not have a material misstatement or loss.MANAGEMENT STRUCTUREThe Board sets formal authorisation levels and other controls that allow it to delegate authority to run our businesses to the Chief Executive, GELT and their management teams. Our management supplements these controls by setting the operating standards that each subsidiary needs for its business and location.GELT regularly reviews our performance against strategy, budget and a defined set of operational key performance indicators. The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, and Group Financial Controller also hold monthly reviews with each business unit.QUALITY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR PEOPLEWe strive to operate with high integrity in everything we do. Our control environment depends on high-quality people who maintain our ethical standards. We ensure our people’s ability and integrity through our recruitment standards, training and consistent performance management. The Board is informed of appointments to our most senior management positions.INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEMSWe create detailed operational budgets for the year ahead, along with five-year strategic plans, which the Board reviews and approves. We then monitor our performance throughout the year, so we can address any issues. The information we consider includes our monthly financial results, key performance indicators and variances, updated full-year forecasts and key business risks.The main internal control and risk management processes relating to our preparation of consolidated accounts are our Group-wide accounting policies AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORT contInueD\f69CORPORATE GOVERNANCEand procedures, segregation of duties, system access controls, a robust consolidation and reporting system, various levels of management review and centrally defined process control points and reconciliation processes.INVESTMENT APPRAISALWe control our capital expenditure through our budget process and by having clear authorisation levels, above which our businesses must submit  detailed written proposals to the  Board for approval.We carry out due diligence for business acquisitions and material licences, and conduct post-completion reviews of major projects, to ensure we identify areas for improvement and correct any areas of underperformance or overspend.INTERNAL AUDITOur internal audit activities are provided by in-house and external resources, under the leadership of our Head of Risk Management and internal audit. During the year, Internal Audit completed a risk-based audit programme agreed by the Audit & Risk Committee. The Committee reviews the results of these audits and the subsequent actions we take, which we also communicate to the external auditor.All business units complete risk and control self-assessments twice a year. Internal audit, as part of its work programme, performs independent reviews of these assessments to identify any deficiencies  in our controls and how we should address them. The external auditor also provides observations on the control environment as part of its audit work. The results are communicated to senior management and the Audit & Risk Committee.The Board, with the help of the Audit & Risk Committee, reviewed the effectiveness of our internal control system, as well as our financial, operational and compliance controls and our risk management. The review considered our internal control self-assessment process, which is designed to assess compliance with our minimum control standards, the independent internal audit programme, and the reports management prepared when the Board approved the interim and final results and financial statements. It also assessed: >whether we had identified, evaluated, managed and controlled significant risks; and whether any significant weaknesses had arisen, and >if so, whether we had addressed them.The assessment also took into account any risk or control issues we identified through our divisional business reviews, Board and GELT meetings, and  insurers’ reviews.We have an internal control continuous improvement work programme and routinely identify opportunities to strengthen our control environment and improve our risk management capabilities. However, the Board has not identified or been told of any significant failings in our internal controls.\f70Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021AIMS OF OUR REMUNERATION POLICY >To reflect the continued transformation into a global agricultural biotechnology pioneer. >Pursuit of leading-edge technology and focus on long-term innovation and environmental sustainability to enable future value creation for shareholders. >Sustainable robust short-term delivery of financial performance as we invest in the future. >Ability to recognise innovation and progress, which are crucial to securing long-term bottom-line performance. >Ability to attract and motivate a high-quality leadership team and drive focus and behaviours on long-term achievement in a global market  for talent. >Recognise expectations of shareholders on reward and governance.Dear ShareholderOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2021. This has been a challenging year for the global economy as companies have looked to maintain business continuity in the face of a global pandemic. I am pleased to report that Genus has delivered a very strong set of results against this backdrop, which is described extensively within the Annual Report. This Remuneration Report covers the activity of the Committee during the year, including the determination of reward outcomes for executives against the targets set. WIDER EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND REWARD OVERSIGHT As a Committee, we have continued to focus on wider oversight of reward practices across the business, as well as monitoring levels of employee engagement. Due to COVID-19, Lykele  van der Broek and myself held online sessions with several teams as it was not possible for face-to-face meetings to take place. We discussed business progress, employee satisfaction and  a particular focus on getting feedback on the business response to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the business carried out an interim pulse survey covering around 800 employees, designed to understand how people viewed the business response to COVID-19 across different countries and roles within Genus, the findings of which were discussed by the Board. While the pandemic has clearly had differing impacts across the countries where our employees are based, people were highly positive about the business response to the pandemic, and the way that adjustments had been made to ways of working and the embracing of new technology and communication channels to maintain momentum of business activity and a sense of belonging. This Remuneration Report has been prepared so it complies with the provisions of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, which set out the disclosures required for Directors’ remuneration as at the reporting date. The Report is also in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules.The Independent Auditor’s Report states whether, in the auditor’s opinion, the parts of the Report that are subject to audit have been properly prepared in accordance with the legislation. We have highlighted the parts of this Report which have been audited.REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORTSection A – Annual statementLESLEY KNOXSENIOR INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEEKEY HIGHLIGHTS >Adjusted profit before tax +29% >Adjusted earnings per share +31% >Strong progress against strategic targets\f71CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe fact that this level of business performance has been achieved reflects the leadership displayed throughout the organisation and the focus, contribution, and resilience of all Genus employees. I join with the Board in thanking all our people for the part they have played in delivering this performance. Genus is an essential part of the food chain and business activity has been successfully maintained over the year. The business has not used any optional government schemes (such as furlough in the UK) or created changes to employee compensation as a result of the pandemic. We have considered the potential impact of COVID-19 on the future application of our Policy. Our conclusion was that the Policy remains appropriate for the business and underlying strategy at this time, and we will look to operate the Policy on the same basis for the year ahead.  As described in more detail within the report we have been able to set forward-looking targets (both financial and non-financial) which reflect the markets in which we operate against which performance will be assessed. CASCADE OF REWARD PRINCIPLES THROUGH THE BUSINESSWe discussed the way that reward principles apply throughout the business, and how approaches in place for senior leaders cascade through the organisation. In particular, we focused on the combination of individual and business targets in determining variable reward outcomes at all levels, and the way that targets used for GELT members (including the Executive Directors) are applied through the business. We considered gender pay within Genus Breeding Limited, our largest UK subsidiary, and noted the way that the gender balance is continuing to change with a far higher proportion of female joiners, and the overall increase in gender diversity across the business. We also discussed the CEO pay ratio, full details of which can be found within this report, including comparison with prior years. The overall CEO ratio has increased year on year, reflective of the high levels of business performance and the significant growth in the share price since PSP awards were made in October 2018. We have provided more insight and a granular breakdown of this change to demonstrate the alignment between pay and performance. The CEO highlighted his appreciation of all that employees have contributed to the business over the past year, and we were supportive of the decision to award a special one-off financial award to all eligible employees globally, which comprised around 3,200 people. Additionally, we were updated on the wider governance framework for reward within the business, including the steps being taken to ensure line managers are engaged in making appropriate reward decisions for their team members, and that these align with the overarching pay for performance philosophy in place across the business. BUSINESS PERFORMANCEA focus on strategic progress ensures that we are well placed to enable future growth. Key highlights during 2021 include development of new strategic partnerships within our PIC business, the next stage of progress of our PRRSv programme, insight as to how we position sustainability at our core of how we operate as a business and actions we are taking to reduce our operational greenhouse gas footprint, and the progress we are making in superior genetics in beef. Internally we have also seen the continued rollout of our GenusOne enterprise system across North America as part of the Global implementation. Coupled with this strategic progress has been the delivery of some very strong financial performance. Adjusted profit before tax (excluding gene editing) grew by 28% in constant currency. We have also achieved strong cash generation, exceeding budgets set by £8.1m. \f72Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDSection A – Annual statementREWARD OUTCOMES FOR 2021As highlighted elsewhere in the report, the Group has changed its accounting policy relating to the capitalisation of certain software assets following the guidance published in April 2021. We have considered the way we reflect this within our reward outcomes. Targets for the 2018 PSP were set before the policy change and we have calculated the PSP vesting and Annual Bonus outcomes excluding the impact of this change. Including the change would have created identical outcomes under the Annual Bonus and slightly higher vesting levels under the PSP. Future vesting of PSP awards (and targets for the 2022 Annual Bonus) will be determined including the impact of this accounting policy change in both the base year and final year of the respective performance period.Against this performance backdrop we determined outcomes under the Annual Bonus plan and the level of vesting of share awards made under our PSP to GELT members in October 2018. Full details of targets and the associated performance against them are disclosed within the report, with outcomes summarised below. Annual BonusThe total opportunity for each Executive Director for the year was 175% of salary, and the overall formulaic outcome generated an award level of 94.8% of maximum for Stephen and 96.5% of maximum for Alison. This was a reflection of very strong financial performance against stretching financial targets set, coupled with demonstrable delivery against strategic goals for each individual. We were very comfortable that the formulaic outcome under the Annual Bonus was an accurate reflection of the performance achieved during the year and demonstrated full alignment with the shareholder experience. In line with our Annual Bonus structure, one-third of the award will be delivered in Genus shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) that are released after three years. The financial achievement delivers maximum awards under the financial metrics of the Annual Bonus for each Executive, and the same will be true for many employees across Genus who are assessed against the same Genus Group performance metrics and targets when their own variable remuneration is calculated. Performance Share PlanAwards made in October 2018 were linked to EPS performance over the three-year period ending 30 June 2021. Average annual EPS growth was 12.6% against a performance range of 5% (which would deliver 20% of the award) through to full vesting at 15% or above. These are calculated on an actual currency basis. Given the robust nature of business performance over the three-year period, the level of vesting (at a strong level but below full vesting) is indicative of the currency headwinds that the business has faced over this time. The value of the PSP within the single figure table is heavily linked to the robust share price growth over the period – from a share price at award of £23.17 to a share price for the last quarter of the financial year of £50.62, an increase of 118.5%. These shares are subject to a holding period of a further two years post-vesting, after allowing for a number of shares to be sold to cover the associated tax liability. LOOKING FORWARD TO 2022We will operate the same core structure of Annual Bonus and PSP for the coming year with no changes in overall opportunity levels for Executives. The Annual Bonus will continue to be assessed through key financial metrics (adjusted profit before tax and generation of free cash flow), alongside a number of identified strategic measures that have been set for each Executive, including targets specifically linked to environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) metrics. Just under one-third of the strategic element will be assessed against environmental and sustainability targets for the business, recognising the importance of this topic for wider society, but particularly acknowledging the role that our sector can play in this area. We remain committed to comprehensive disclosure of targets within future remuneration disclosures with use of externally reported or audited metrics where possible. We have set profit targets for the year (disclosed later in the report) that require continued growth in profit (measured in constant currency) before any award is paid under the metric. In determining the growth targets we considered multiple factors, including the budget set for coming year, the exceptionally strong performance achieved in 2021, and the market headwinds expected across certain of our key markets (in particular China). Therefore, while we have set targets that continue to require absolute levels of profit growth year on year, these are lower in percentage terms from those operated in 2021, with target awards requiring 5% growth and stretch levels set at 10% growth or above. Any bonus payable under this metric would remain consistent with delivery of performance ahead of our stated medium-term growth objective when viewed over a multi-year period. These targets are cascaded throughout the business and apply to all employees whose Annual Bonus is linked to Group performance. We continue to focus on ensuring that targets reward growth of the business, and that the target level of performance required represents strong performance for the business with exceptional levels of performance needed to generate full awards under the metric, and ensuring that targets are aligned to budgets and motivational for participants. The PSP award will continue to be assessed against EPS performance over the three-year period (2022 to 2025) with the associated performance range (of annual growth in EPS of 5% to 15%) consistent with the operation of awards in recent years and in line with our stated medium term growth objectives. Salary levels have been increased for the CEO and CFO effective 1 September 2021 in line with budgeted increases for employees of Genus plc within the UK. Both Executives receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension contributions. The CFO joined the business in January 2020, and this was set at 6% of salary, in line with the average across the wider UK workforce and will remain at this level. In recognition of investor expectations in this area, the current supplement paid to the CEO (of 10% of salary) will reduce to the 6% level at the end of December 2022. \f73CORPORATE GOVERNANCEPOLICY RENEWAL2021 was the second year of the current Remuneration Policy that was agreed by shareholders in 2019. We continue to believe that the core of our Policy is appropriate and drives alignment between business performance and reward outcomes. It is important that we ensure that the Policy remains appropriate for the strategy of the business, the continued growth of the organisation and the global environment that Genus operates within. We are also aware of the evolving expectations of shareholders and proxy agencies on reward. The Committee has started to discuss areas where we expect to focus in considering a new Policy that we will present for approval next year. Particular areas that we expect to include within consultation with shareholders include: >a desire to review the performance metrics within the PSP Plan and the way we could include specific measure(s) linked to our environmental performance and sustainability progress; >the way we look to set annual targets for our Annual Bonus plan in future, recognising the potential for some variability in year-on-year growth while in pursuit of our medium-term stated growth aspirations; and  >overall competitiveness of reward against the changing scale and complexity of Genus as a global biotechnology organisation.We plan to consult with key shareholders in the first quarter of calendar year 2022 on our thinking and look forward to gaining their perspectives ahead of tabling a revised Remuneration Policy at the AGM next year. SUMMARYI hope this introduction and accompanying disclosures give you an insight into the operation of the Committee, the increasing breadth of focus of the nature of our conversations, and the way we have sought alignment between business performance and reward outcomes. I look forward to your support at our forthcoming AGM.

It receives updates annually on any material changes to wider workforce arrangements and additionally considers employee feedback on reward matters. This is from Group-wide mechanisms (such as our Your Voice survey) but additionally from direct interaction between designated Non-Executive Directors and employees.Our reward principles apply to all employees within the business and are designed to ensure we can attract, motivate and retain people fundamental to achieving our vision, and be part of a global organisation. We want people within the business engaged and delivering because they are excited by our vision, the part they can play in this, and the difference they can make.These principles are applied as consistently as we can, such that reward is standardised wherever possible, and delivered in line with our values. While the quantum may vary between roles, the principle of aligning reward outcomes with performance is fundamental to the way we operate.Reward elementOur approachBASE SALARYPay rates are determined with reference to the skill set and experience of the individual. Most pay rates are reviewed annually across the Group, with adjustments with reference to individual performance levels, market pay competitiveness and overall business affordability.BENEFITSThe countries we operate in display different practices in terms of benefit provision. Typical benefits include access to life insurance, pension or retirement provision and may include medical cover. Our approach is driven by local market factors (which may include legislative requirements) rather than a single common benefit offering globally.VARIABLE PAYWe operate a range of annual variable reward schemes and most of our employees participate in one of these arrangements. These include:Annual Bonus >Based on a combination of financial performance and non-financial metrics assessed through our performance management processes (which all employees participate in). >Financial metrics based around profitability and cash performance. >Where metrics are consistent with those used for Executive Directors or GELT members, then the same target/performance scale is used for everyone to drive alignment.Production facilities – KPI plans >Linked to the balanced scorecard of local KPIs for facility, covering metrics such as production output levels and health and safety.Commissions >Derived from individual sales performance of the individual.In addition, we make discretionary awards of shares across the business annually, reflecting the contribution of the individual and to drive future alignment with our performance.Alignment of our Remuneration Policy to the Provisions of the 2018 Code (Section 40)ClarityImplementation of the strategy is monitored through KPIs including those used within the Annual Bonus and PSP. This ensures alignment between strategy execution and reward outcomes. SimplicityWe look to describe the structure of reward clearly to both participants and shareholders through effective disclosures, so all stakeholders are clear on the underlying reward principles and the way reward outcomes are determined. Alignment to cultureThe Policy aligns to our business model and focus on the experience of customers and employees. Metrics linked to culture are used within variable plans, alongside delivery of long-term sustainable performance. PredictabilityExamples of the range of outcomes under the Policy are shown within the scenario graphs. This demonstrates the way that different performance levels change reward outcomes for individuals and the associated impact of changes in the company share price.Proportionality A significant proportion of the total reward opportunity is performance driven, with clear linkage between business metrics and reward outcomes through clear targets and use of KPIs.Shares form the majority of variable reward and Executives are required to develop and maintain a material shareholding in the business to fully align to the shareholder experience.RiskThe Committee retain ultimate discretion to vary outcomes from formulaic results if they do not judge this to accurately reflect underlying business performance.Malus and clawback provisions apply to all awards and we operate post-cessation shareholding requirements to further align Executives to long-term business performance.\f77CORPORATE GOVERNANCESection B – CEO Pay RatioOUR CEO PAY RATIO FOR 2021Our CEO pay ratio is shown below.

Where required, actual levels of remuneration were adjusted to create full-time equivalent values by considering both the employees full-time equivalent hours and (where applicable) the proportion of the year that the individual was employed. The quartile values, split between salary and benefits are as follows:25th percentileMedian75th percentileSalary (FTE)£23.854£27,300£36,102Total pay and benefits£27,374£32,464£43,796The median ratio is consistent with pay and reward policies in operation within the business. Salaries are set with reference to market levels of pay, with progression linked to experience and performance in role. The structure of reward in operation means that a greater proportion of pay is linked to variable pay in more senior roles and will therefore fluctuate linked to business and individual performance outcomes against targets set, and to changes in the Genus share price. OUR CEO PAY RATIO HISTORYTo provide additional context we have also shown the ratio for the previous three years. For illustration we have also shown the  ratios against the target level of reward we disclosed within our Remuneration Policies as agreed by shareholders and provided commentary below. Reward structure – That the overall CEO package is more highly geared towards variable pay than most other employees within the UK business.Business performance – As outlined elsewhere within this disclosure, 2021 was a robust year for the business with strong profit growth. This has resulted in high levels of award against stretching targets set for the Annual Bonus, and in vesting levels of over 81.2% from PSP awards made in 2018 which were linked to EPS performance over the three-year period. Change of CEO – The CEO ‘single figure’ for year ending 2019 was lower than the prior year. This reflected the decision of our previous CEO to resign from the business and forfeit any awards under our Annual Bonus or long-term incentive, albeit he was still employed by Genus at the end of the financial year.Share price growth – We have seen significant growth in the share price with the average share price for the last three months of 2021 of 5,062p which was an increase of 50% on the same period the year before.

METHOD OF CALCULATION AND RATIONALEWe have elected to use calculation Method A as outlined within the legislation. We have done this to get as accurate a picture as possible for the reward of all our UK employees compared to the CEO. This contrasts with our disclosure on gender pay which focuses on our largest UK subsidiary (Genus Breeding Limited) rather than all employees in the UK as required by the respective legislation. It ensures that the calculation is done on a full-time equivalent basis in comparing employee reward to the CEO position.\f78Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDSection C – Remuneration and Performance StatementGENUS’S STRATEGY AND ITS LINK TO PERFORMANCE-RELATED PAYOur strategy and the way this is linked to variable reward is shown below.PERFORMANCE COMPONENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON REMUNERATION2020restated2021Movement %Impact on remunerationAdjusted resultsRevenue£551.4m£574.3m4%Input to Annual Bonus profit and earnings per share in PSPAdjusted profit before tax£65.8m£84.8m29%Annual Bonus measureGeneration of free cash flow£35.2m£37.5m7%Annual Bonus measureAdjusted earnings per share77.3p100.9p31%PSP performance conditionDividend per share29.1p32.0p10%Executives rewarded via dividends on shares held post vestingShare price at year end3,532p4,960p40%Determines the value of deferred bonuses and PSP awardsValues in the table are in actual currency as shown in the Annual Report.

Remuneration in respect of 2021 is determined by our Remuneration Policy agreed by 93.4% of shareholders at the 2019 AGM. The detailed Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM on 14 November 2019, can be found in our 2019 Annual Report which is available from our website at www.genusplc.com.We have split this section into the following chapters to balance our formal disclosure obligations with our desire to have a clear and understandable report:1. What the Executive Directors Were Paid in 2021.2. What the Executive Directors Can Earn in 2022.3. The Process the Committee Followed to Arrive at These Decisions.4. How the Chief Executive’s Pay Compares to Shareholder Returns Over the Past Ten Years and to Employees’ Pay.5. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ Fees.6. Details of the Directors’ Shareholdings and Rights to Shares.7. Details of the Executive Directors’ Contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment.1. WHAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS WERE PAID IN 2021Executive Directors’ single total remuneration figure (audited)The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the 2021 financial year for each of the Executive Directors and compares this figure to the prior year.YearSalary and fees£000sBenefits1£000sPension2£000sSubtotal for fixed pay£000sAnnual bonus3£000sPSP£000sSubtotal for variable pay£000sTotal£000sStephen Wilson202160013606739981,21742,2152,888(ceased to be Group Finance Director and  appointed CEO from 13 September 2019)2020550135962294559451,5392,161Alison Henriksen20214071224443689–6891,132(appointed 13 January 2020)2020190612208297–2975051 Benefits included an annual car allowance of £12,000 for Stephen Wilson and Alison Henriksen respectively. Insured benefits include life assurance, private medical insurance and a medical screen.2 Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension, which is shown in the Pension column. The percentage contribution payable to Stephen Wilson was reduced on appointment to CEO (from Group Finance Director) from 15% of salary to 10% of salary. Alison Henriksen receives a pension contribution of 6% of salary.3 Bonus earned includes the part of the award which is deferred into Company shares.4 The value of the PSP is determined by the number of awards vesting in relation to performance in the period ended 30 June 2021. Dividend equivalents are not added to awards made under the PSP. The value shown for 2021 is based on the average share price for the final three months of the 2021 financial year (which was 5,062p). This compares to the share price at grant of 2,317p (+118.5%). Of the value shown for the CEO, £660k is attributable to share price appreciation between award and vesting.5 The 2020 values shown as estimated in the previous Annual Report have been restated to reflect the actual value at point of vesting. The share price was 3,956p on 14 September 2020 when awards vested for Stephen Wilson.How the bonuses for 2021 were calculatedAnnual BonusThe 2021 bonuses for Executive Directors were calculated by reference to performance against a challenging sliding scale of profit, cash flow and strategic measures. Targets were set by the Committee to exclude the costs of gene editing in line with our Remuneration Policy. This was a decision by the Committee (as was the case in prior years) to ensure that management’s reward was not unfairly affected by decisions to make the right long-term investment decisions on behalf of the business.The following results were achieved for each element of the annual bonus incentive.Bonus target1Strategic objectiveWeightingActual 2021 performanceThreshold  (0% award)Target  (50% award)Stretch  (full award)Extent to which targets were met (%)Adjusted profit before taxYear-on-year profit growth50%£97.2m2£76.2m£83.8m£87.6m100%Generation of free cash flowGenerate cash for reinvestment and dividends15%£29.1m3£18m£21m£24m100%Strategic measuresTo build the foundation for future growth35%See tableChief Executive 85%  Chief Financial Officer 90%1 The financial elements of the bonus are payable on a straight-line basis between each threshold, target and stretch level.2 Numbers shown exclude the impact of the change of the accounting Policy linked to the capitalisation of certain software assets. The Committee made the decision to calculate awards in this way (albeit the outcome would have been the same if these costs had been reflected in 2020 and 2021 performance).3 This number excludes £8.4m of IFRS 16 lease adjustments included in our reported free cash flow number on page 78.\f80Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDSection D – Annual Report on Remuneration1.

WHAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS WERE PAID IN 2021 contInueDAs a result of this performance, the total Annual Bonus awarded to the Executive Directors was:Annual BonusExtent to which targets were metAnnual Bonus – cashAnnual Bonus – deferred shares1Stephen Wilson94.8%£665,240£332,620Alison Henriksen96.5%£459,340£229,6701 The number of shares awarded will be calculated in September 2021 when bonuses are paid. One-third of bonus payable is deferred into Genus shares for three years.How the PSP figure was calculated in the single total remuneration tableStephen Wilson’s PSP award granted on 9 October 2018 was subject to a performance condition, based on the growth in adjusted earnings per share from 2018 to 2021. The range of targets applicable to the award, which had a value of 175% of salary at grant was as follows:Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share% of award vestingLess than 5% per annumNil5% per annum20%15% per annum100%1 Straight-line vesting between the points in the above table.The Committee set targets to calculate the long-term award after excluding gene editing costs incurred during the performance period, to avoid an unintended impact on the Executives’ remuneration whilst making long-term decisions in support of value creation. This is consistent with the approach previously communicated to shareholders within our Policy and as taken in each of the last three years.The adjusted 2021 earnings per share after the cost of share-based payments and adjusting for costs relating to gene editing was 104p. This represents an average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 12.6% compared to the comparable 2018 adjusted earnings per share figure (after the cost of share-based payments). The resulting level of vesting is 81.2% of maximum1. Stephen Wilson’s award was over a maximum of 29,613 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 24,046 shares and these will vest on 9 October 2021.The Committee made the decision to calculate vesting excluding the impact of the accounting change linked to capitalisation of costs of certain software assets. This was done on the basis of driving consistency between the base year and final outcome, and recognise the timing of the actual change in the accounting policy. We additionally noted that had this impact been included then the resulting vesting level would have been slightly higher. The Company’s average share price for the period from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 was 5,062p, meaning that the value shown for these awards within the single figure table is £1,217,196 for Stephen Wilson.£000s1,4001,2008001,0002004006000Value atawardValue of shares lapsedValue of shares vestingSharepricegrowthValue at30 June2021£686,133£137,227£548,907£650,301£1,217,196CEO reward alignment to share price performanceShare price on award = £23.17Share price (three months ending 30 June 2021) = £50.62Share price growth over period = 118.5%1 The average annual earnings per share growth including gene editing costs after share-based payments was 12.6% and the associated vesting level would have been 80.8% of maximum.Joining awardThere were no joining awards made to Directors in the year ending 30 June 2021. Material contractsThere were no other contracts or arrangements during the financial year in which a Director of the Company was materially interested and/or which were significant in relation to the Group’s business.Payments for loss of office and payments to former Directors (audited)There were no payments for loss of office in the year or to any former Directors of the business.DiscretionNo discretion was applied by the Committee to outcomes under the variable plans and awards were determined against targets set by the Committee. The Committee was fully satisfied that the outcomes delivered were consistent with the strong business performance delivered.\f82Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDSection D – Annual Report on Remuneration2. WHAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CAN EARN IN 2022A summary of this chapter is given on page 75.Base salaryIn line with other UK employees, the date of salary review is 1 September 2021. Any change is considered against changes made to the wider workforce.Annual salary to  1 Sep 2021Annual salary from  1 Sep 2021Change  %Stephen Wilson£601,800£616,9002.5%Alison Henriksen£408,000£418,2002.5%BenefitsThe Executive Directors receive benefits including a car allowance, life assurance, an annual medical screen and private medical insurance.PensionOn appointment to the CEO role in September 2019, the pension allowance payable to Stephen Wilson reduced to 10% of salary (from 15%). Alison Henriksen receives a pension allowance of 6% of salary, consistent with our stated Policy to align rates for new hires to the wider workforce. In line with investor expectations, the allowance paid to the CEO will reduce to 6% of salary from the end of December 2022. Performance-related Annual BonusThe structure for variable remuneration for Executive Directors for 2022 will be as follows:Annual BonusValue of BonusA maximum of 175% of salary for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer based on profit, cash generation and strategic measures.Performance measuresAssessed across the following metrics:Adjusted Profit Before Tax – 50% of opportunityCash Generation – 15% of opportunityStrategic measures – 35% of opportunityCalibration of  profit targetThe targets for the coming year are outlined below and have continued to be disclosed on a prospective basis, expressed in terms of growth. The targets have been set having considered the budgets in place for the year and represent stretching business performance. The Committee considered budgets, analyst expectations and the market conditions in our key countries in determining the range and is comfortable that the range set is stretching, and fully aligned to our stated medium-term growth objective.No bonus is payable in respect of profit unless the prior year’s result is exceeded. Thereafter, the bonus award is determined on the following basis:Growth on prior year adjusted before tax1Pay-out (profit element)0% growth or belowNil award5% growth 50% award10% growth or above100% awardStraight-line payout between performance points.1 In constant currency and excluding gene editing costs.Calibration of cash generation targetThe cash target is the budgeted figure, with a specific range of £3m below the target and £3m above.Specific numbers were set (rather than a percentage range) to ensure Executives are focused on actual cash generation. The target set and resulting performance achieved will be disclosed in the Annual Report next year.Calibration of strategic measuresSpecific measurable targets have been set against this category linked to our strategic priorities identified by the Board for the year ahead. Approximately one-third (10% out of the 35%) will be linked to specific targets linked to environmental measures. It would be commercially sensitive to disclose these targets in advance and we will retrospectively disclose the targets and associated performance against them in the subsequent Annual Report.Bonus deferralOne-third of any bonus award will be deferred by way of shares for three years and will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain leaver circumstances.Malus and clawbackThe Committee can apply malus to deferred bonuses and clawback any element of paid bonuses that should not have been awarded or paid, in the event of a material misstatement of the Group’s annual results or other substantive reason.\f83CORPORATE GOVERNANCE2. WHAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CAN EARN IN 2022 contInueDLong-term incentivesAwards to be granted in September 2021 will be granted under the 2019 PSP Plan approved by shareholders on 14 November 2019. Stephen Wilson will be granted an award over shares worth 200% of salary and Alison Henriksen an award over shares worth 175% of salary. Grants will be determined in line with the Plan Rules, using annual salary as at the point of grant to determine awards. Awards granted will continue to require the Executive to retain the after-tax number of shares vesting in September 2024 for two years. Enhanced clawback and malus provisions will apply to these awards as outlined within our Remuneration Policy, including for reputational damage and corporate failure.The performance targets for the awards to be granted in September 2021 will relate to average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share, measured over three years and excluding gene editing costs. The range of targets for the 2022 awards (scheduled to be made in September 2021) is unchanged from that awarded in recent years and is as follows and is as follows:Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share1Vesting  (% award)Less than 5% per annum0%5% per annum20%15% per annum100%Straight-line vesting between performance points shown above.1 Growth in adjusted earnings per share over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share-based payments and excluding gene editing costs.The Committee continues to believe that using adjusted earnings per share is an appropriate measure of long-term performance of the business, demonstrates alignment to our stated medium-term growth aspirations, and this is consistent with awards granted over the past few years. The Committee believes the above performance range is appropriately challenging, incentivises Executives to deliver the Company’s growth strategy and is therefore aligned with shareholders’ interests. The Committee retains the discretion to be able to scale back vesting based on earnings per share performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Company’s strategy during the performance period. This is considered appropriate to broaden the Executive team’s focus beyond financial performance. 3. THE PROCESS THE COMMITTEE FOLLOWED TO ARRIVE AT THESE DECISIONSThe Committee complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code. It makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT.

The Committee is supported by the Group HR Director, Group Reward Director, Finance and Company Secretariat functions.During the year, the Committee continued to use PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’) for advice it considers is of value, objective and independent. PwC’s fees were £45k for its remuneration advice to the Committee. PwC were appointed by the Committee following a competitive tender process and their performance and independence as advisers is regularly reviewed. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its Code of Conduct. Separate teams within PwC provide unrelated advisory service to the Group, including taxation, international assignments and actuarial advice to the Group.\f84Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT contInueDSection D – Annual Report on Remuneration3.

The process also includes sharing feedback received through staff engagement surveys that include questions on pay, as well as consulting employees informally on their views of the current overall Remuneration Policy. Additionally, discussions on reward have formed part of dialogue between the nominated Non-Executive Directors and employees as part of wider engagement activity as outlined elsewhere in the Annual Report. This forms part of the feedback provided to the Committee and is used to assess the Remuneration Policy’s ongoing effectiveness and any changes that should be made.When setting the Executive Directors’ base salaries, the Committee compares the salary increases proposed for each Executive Director with those proposed for employees in their geographical location, as well as considering the typical increase proposed across our UK business and the wider Group.\f85CORPORATE GOVERNANCE4.

Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:Dan HartleyGroup General Counsel  and Company Secretary8 September 2021\f96Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIESThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The Directors have chosen to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.In preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: >select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; >make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; >state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ has been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; and >prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors: >properly select and apply accounting policies; >present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; >provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and >make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.

OpinionIn our opinion: >the financial statements of Genus plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2021 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; >the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’); >the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and >the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.We have audited the financial statements which comprise: >the Group Income Statement; >the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income; >the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; >the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets; >the Group Statement of Cash Flows; and >the related notes 1 to 42 and C1 to C20.The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs as issued by the IASB. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).2. Basis for opinionWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the Group and Parent Company for the year are disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.3. Summary of our audit approachKey audit mattersThe key audit matter that we identified in the current year was: >Valuation of Biological Assets under IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’.Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows: Newly identified Increased level of risk Similar level of risk Decreased level of riskMaterialityThe materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £3.3m which was determined on the basis of Profit before Tax (‘PBT’), excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets.ScopingOur audit scope covered 13 components. Of these, eight were subject to a full scope audit, and five were subject to specified procedures. Our testing achieved coverage of 79% of Revenue, 83% of Net Assets and 88% of PBT, excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets.Significant changes in our approachIn the current year we assessed the valuation of goodwill attributed to the ABS cash-generating unit (‘ABS CGU’) to no longer be a key audit matter, reflecting the continued improvement in the ABS CGU’s financial performance.\f98Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUEDTo the Members of Genus plc4. Conclusions relating to going concernIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: >understanding the Group’s process for assessing the going concern assumption including identification and testing of the design and implementation of relevant management review controls underpinning this assessment; >understanding the relevant assumptions used in the going concern models, including the Strategic Plan, and challenging  them by comparison to our understanding of the business, external information and evidence gathered from other audit procedures, including:– reading analyst reports, industry data and other external information inspecting them for corroborative and contradictory evidence in relation to management’s assumptions;– challenging forecasted profit by comparison to recent historical financial information; and– challenging the key underlying data used in forecast scenarios by assessing it for consistency with our understanding  of the business; >reviewing the terms of the Group’s existing financing arrangements consisting of a £150m multi-currency RCF, a US$125m RCF and a US$20m bond and guarantee facility, evaluating the associated disclosure provided by management, and reperforming the debt covenant computations over the going concern assessment period; and >evaluating the Group’s disclosures on going concern against the requirements of IAS 1.Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.In relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of  this report.5. Key audit mattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.Valuation of Biological Assets under IAs 41 ‘Agriculture’ Key audit matter descriptionThe Group carries biological assets at fair value in line with the requirements of IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’. Discounted cash flow analyses are performed in determining the valuation. As at 30 June 2021, the Group held total biological assets (excluding those recognised in inventory) of 319.5m (2020: £349.9m).Certain of the assumptions included within management’s valuation models are subject to estimation uncertainty, and accordingly, require the exercise of a significant degree of judgement. In planning our audit, we identified the following management assumptions as being the most significant in the determination of the valuation of each species:Bovine: the future growth rates of proven and genomic semen sales; the Biological Asset Value discount factor; and the discount rate applied.Porcine: the percentage of pureline offspring retained, sold or slaughtered and the discount rates applied to the forecast cash flows.Details of the key source of estimation uncertainty identified, the Group’s accounting policy, and the biological assets held are disclosed in notes 4 and 16 to the financial statements. The Audit & Risk Committee has included their assessment of this key audit matter on page 67.\f99FINANCIAL STATEMENTSHow the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterIn responding to the identified key audit matter, we completed the following audit procedures: >obtained an understanding of controls relevant to the review and approval of the valuation of  biological assets; >assessed the appropriateness of the logic and mechanical accuracy of the valuation models prepared and the methodology applied by management for compliance with the requirements of IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’; >made enquiries of management to understand the rationale applied in the determination of key assumptions and any changes year on year; >challenged the appropriateness of key assumptions applied within the underlying forecasts prepared by management, with consideration given to historical forecasting accuracy, availability of third-party benchmarking data (where appropriate); >substantively tested the underlying transactional data underpinning third-party semen sales and inspected the related contracts (Bovine); >substantively tested the reasonableness of management’s forecasts with regard to the percentages of offspring to be retained, sold or slaughtered with reference to historic transaction data, and further, considered the appropriateness of the forward-looking assumption applied (Porcine); >involved our internal valuation specialists in our consideration as to the appropriateness of the discount rate applied by management in determining the fair value of biological assets; and >assessed the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made within the financial statements in accordance with IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’, and IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’.Key observationsWe are satisfied that the valuation of biological assets and the related disclosures are appropriate.6. Our application of materiality6.1. MaterialityWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:Group financial statementsParent Company financial statementsMateriality£3.3m (2020: £3.0m)£2.6m (2020: £2.5m)Basis for determining materiality5% (2020: 5%) of Profit before Tax excluding the impact of exceptional items (as defined in note 7 and in the Group Income Statement) and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets.The increase in materiality reflects the improved trading performance of the Group.1% (2020: 1%) of net assets.The increase in materiality is in line with the increase in Parent Company’s net assets.Rationale for the benchmark appliedWe have selected this adjusted Profit before Tax measure to determine materiality so as to avoid distortion that could otherwise arise from non-recurring items, highly volatile items or IAS 41 fair value movements.Net assets were selected as an appropriate benchmark for determining materiality, as the Parent Company acts primarily as a holding company.PBT excl. exceptional items and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets £69.9mGroup materiality£3.3mComponent materiality range£1.1m to £1.4mAudit & Risk Committeereporting threshold£165k\f100Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUEDTo the Members of Genus plc6.2. performance materialityWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.Group financial statementsParent Company financial statementsPerformance materiality70% (2020: 70%) of Group materiality70% (2020: 70%) of Parent Company materialityBasis and rationale for determining performance materialityIn determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: >our cumulative knowledge of the Group and its internal control environment; >the low turnover in key management personnel; >the high degree of centralisation in the Group’s financial reporting controls and processes; and >the low number of corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified in prior periods.6.3. error reporting thresholdWe agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £165k (2020: £150k), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit & Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.7. An overview of the scope of our audit7.1. Identification and scoping of componentsOur audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.Components were selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified. Based on that assessment, we identified 13 components of interest for the purposes of the Group audit (2020: 12). Of these components, eight were designated as subject to full scope audit procedures (2020: nine), with the remaining five subject to specified procedures (2020: three). Excluding the Parent Company, our component audits were performed using materiality between £1.1m and £1.4m (2020: £1.0m and £1.4m). These components represent the principal business units and account for 79% of the Group’s Revenue (2020: 76%), 83% of the Group’s Net Assets (2020: 81%) and 88% of the Group’s PBT, excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets (2020: 83%).In the current year we performed specified procedures audit in respect of PIC Russia (2020: out of scope), reflecting its growing contribution to the Group. PIC Chile was reduced from a full scope audit to specified procedures, reflecting an overall decline in the component’s contribution to the Group.At the Group level, we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to full scope audit or specified procedures.1112223331 Full scope audit  78%2 Speciﬁed procedures 5%3 Revenue at Group level 17%1 Full scope audit  80%2 Speciﬁed procedures 8%3 Revenue at Group level 12%1 Full scope audit  72%2 Speciﬁed procedures 7%3 Revenue at Group level 21%REVENUEPROFIT BEFORE TAX1NET ASSETS1 Excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets.7.2. Working with other auditorsThe Group audit team engaged component audit teams to perform the audit procedures as set out in section 7.1. The Group audit team held regular communication with the component auditors in planning for, and throughout, the year-end audit process. Oversight of the component auditors included attending internal planning and status meetings, attending close meetings held with local management, and reviewing relevant audit documentation.In light of the travel restrictions and widespread lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic we were not able to complete our normal programme of planned visits. In response to these restrictions we enhanced our remote oversight through a number of measures, as appropriate to each component, including more frequent dialogue and use of video conferencing and screen-sharing facilities.\f101FINANCIAL STATEMENTS8. Other informationThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon namely the Strategic Report, Corporate Governance Sections and the Additional Information sections. The Directors  are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.We have nothing to report in this regard.9. Responsibilities of DirectorsAs explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraudIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which  our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularitiesIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following: >the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for Directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets; >results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, and the Audit & Risk Committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities; >any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:– identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;– detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;– the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; >the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, and IT specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, pensions legislation, and global tax legislation.In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the Group’s compliance with health and safety regulations and environmental regulations.\f102Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUEDTo the Members of Genus plc11.2. Audit response to risks identifiedAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.Our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: >reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements; >enquiring of management, the Audit & Risk Committee, and in-house and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims; >performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; >reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, and reviewing internal audit reports; and >in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, our procedures included:– testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments which display potential fraudulent risk factors; in performing this work, we specifically applied a broader range of risk factors to manual adjustments to revenue in order to increase the number of selected transactions from revenue;– assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias including, in particular, judgements over forecasting, pensions, revenue recognition, uncertain tax positions and discount rates applied by the business; and– evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: >the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and >the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.13. Corporate Governance StatementThe Listing Rules require us to review the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: >the Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 49; >the Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 49; >the Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 96; >the Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on pages 46 to 48; >the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 67 to 68; and >the section describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee set out on page 65 to 69.\f103FINANCIAL STATEMENTS14.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor the year ended 30 June 20211. REPORTING ENTITYGenus plc (the ‘Company’) is a public company limited by shares and incorporated in England, United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. Its company number is 02972325 and its registered office is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4DZ. The Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). We have used the equity method to account for the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates. Our business model on pages 10 to 11 explains the Group’s operations and principal activities.2. BASIS OF PREPARATIONWe have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The Group Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements. The going concern statement has been included in the Strategic Report on page 49 and forms part of these statements.Functional and presentational currencyWe present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.Use of estimatesPreparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our application of accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting estimates in the period in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in applying accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’)In reporting financial information, the Group presents APMs, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS and which are not considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures.The Group believes that these APMs provide stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business. The APMs are consistent with how we plan our business performance and report on it in our internal management reporting to the Board and GELT. Some of these measures are also used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets.For a full list of all APMs please see the Alternative Performance Measures section of the Annual Report on pages 180 to 187.Change in accounting policy – Software as a service (‘SaaS’) arrangementsThe Company has changed its accounting policy related to the capitalisation of certain software costs; this change follows the IFRIC Interpretation Committee’s agenda decision published in April 2021 and relates to the capitalisation of costs of configuring or customising application software under ‘Software as a Service’ (‘SaaS’) arrangements.The Group’s accounting policy has historically been to capitalise costs directly attributable to the configuration and customisation of SaaS arrangements as intangible assets in the Balance Sheet, irrespective of whether the services were performed by the SaaS supplier or third party. Following the adoption of the above IFRIC agenda guidance, current SaaS arrangements were identified and assessed to determine if the Group has control of the software. For those arrangements where we do not have control of the developed software, to the extent that the services were performed by third parties, the Group derecognised the intangible asset previously capitalised. Amounts paid to the supplier in advance of the commencement of the service period, including for configuration or customisation, are treated as a prepayment.This change in accounting policy led to adjustments amounting to a £13.3m and £8.1m reduction in the intangible assets recognised in the 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 Balance Sheets respectively, and to a £5.2m and £5.9m increase in operating expenses within administrative expenses, in those respective years. Accordingly, the prior period Balance Sheets at 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 have been restated in accordance with IAS 8, and, in accordance with IAS 1 (revised), a Balance Sheet at 30 June 2019 is also presented, together with related notes. The tables on the following page show the impact of the change in accounting policy on previously reported financial results.\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021110Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 20212.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD THAT RELATE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS A WHOLEThis section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the Financial Statements, the policy has been described in that note. We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.Accounting conventionWe prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets, share-based payment expense, pension liabilities and derivative financial instruments. In accordance with IFRS, we measure biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent distribution costs and selling expenses, and share-based payment expense, pension liabilities, and certain financial instruments at fair value.Basis of consolidationSubsidiaries are entities the Group controls. We have control of an entity when we are exposed, or have the rights, to variable returns from the entity and have the ability to affect the returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, we take into account potential voting rights that we can currently exercise or convert. We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date that control transfers to the Group. We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries that we cease to control from the date that control passes.In preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee. We eliminate unrealised losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.Foreign currenciesWe record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entity’s functional currency, at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate on  the balance sheet date. We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the exchange rate at the transaction date. When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign currency, we translate them at the prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value. We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are booked into foreign currency translation reserves and reported in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. We translate these operations’ revenues and expenses using an average rate for the period. When exchange differences arise from the fair value movement of related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve. When we dispose of a foreign operation, we release these differences to the Income Statement. Exchange movements on inter-Company loans considered to be permanent equity are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with any related taxation.The principal exchange rates were as follows:AverageClosing202120202019202120202019US Dollar/£1.361.261.291.381.241.27Euro/£1.131.141.131.171.101.12Brazilian Real/£7.335.744.996.876.774.89Mexican Peso/£28.1526.0825.0427.5728.5224.40Chinese Yuan/£8.948.898.838.938.758.72Russian Rouble/£102.0485.1784.93101.1088.1980.30\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021112Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 20213. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD THAT RELATE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS A WHOLE CONTINUEDResearch and developmentWe undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure in the Income Statement as it is incurred.The Group constantly monitors its research activities. When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are commercially viable, our policy is to capitalise further development costs within intangible assets, in accordance with IAS 38.Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine pre-stud herds. We do not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair value of the Group’s biological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.We disclose the costs of research and development activities, as required by IAS 38 (see note 8).Other income and deferred incomeDuring the year ended 30 June 2019, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration with Beijing Capital Agribusiness (‘BCA’) under which BCA will establish and fund a collaboration specific entity (‘BCA Future Bio-Tech’) which will use Genus’s intellectual property and know-how to pursue the PRRSv resistance regulatory and development work in China. Genus will receive consideration after meeting certain milestones in the development programme.Each milestone is considered to be either a separate performance obligation, or a set of groups of separate performance obligations, under this agreement and are unbundled in the contractual arrangement as if they are distinct from one another. We assess each separate performance obligation relating to the milestone payments, and upon completion of those performance obligations recognise the fair value of amounts earned in other income. Some performance obligations, such as the transfer of know-how, are recognised at a point in time whereas others, such as the provision of technical services, are recognised over time. We recognise any received but unearned consideration as deferred income.We will apply the same accounting policy to any other comparable agreements.Reversals of impairmentWe reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and we have changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it would have had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss. New standards and interpretationsIn the current period, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins after 1 January 2020 and have been implemented with effect from 1 July 2020. These are: >Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS; >Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – ‘Definition of Material’; >Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’; >Amendments to IFRS 3 – ‘Definition of a Business’; and >Amendment to IFRS 16 – ‘COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions’.Their addition has not had any material impact on the disclosures, or amounts reported in the Group Financial Statements.In April 2021, the IFRIC Interpretation Committee published guidance in relation to the capitalisation of costs of configuring or customising application software under ‘Software as a Service’ (‘SaaS’) arrangements. See note 2 for the full impact of the new interpretation.New standards and interpretations not yet adoptedAt the date of the Annual Report, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in the report were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the UK). The Group will continue to assess the impact of these amendments prior to their adoption. These are: >Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 – ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform — Phase 2’;  >Amendment to IFRS 16 – ‘COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021’; >Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current’; >Amendments to IAS 16 – ‘Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use’; >Annual Improvements 2018–2020 Cycle; >Amendments to IAS 37 – ‘Onerous Contracts — Cost of Fulfilling a Contract’; >Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – ‘Disclosure of Accounting Policies’; >Amendments to IAS 12 – ‘Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction’; and >Amendments to IAS 8 – ‘Definition of Accounting Estimates’.\f113FINANCIAL STATEMENTS4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTYThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.Critical judgements represent key decisions made by management in the application of the Group’s accounting policies, where a significant risk of materially different outcomes exists due to management assumptions or sources of estimation uncertainty. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The estimates which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months are discussed below.Critical accounting judgementsAdjusting itemsThe Directors believe that the adjusted profit and earnings per share measures provide additional information to shareholders on  the performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally by the Board and GELT.The profit before tax and adjusting items measures are not recognised profit measures under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies. The classification of adjusting items requires significant judgement, after considering the nature and intentions of a transaction. The Group’s definitions of adjusting items are outlined within the Group accounting policies and have been applied consistently year-on-year.Key sources of estimation uncertaintyDetermination of the fair value of biological assets (note 16)Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires the application of a number of estimates  and assumptions. Below is a list of these estimates and assumptions, showing whether we consider them to be observable or unobservable inputs to the fair value determination. In addition, we identify those inputs that are ‘readily obtainable’ transactional data or ‘open market prices’.Sensitivities of the estimates and assumptions given below are disclosed in note 16.Estimates and assumptionsObservable/UnobservableSourceBovineLong-term dairy volume growth rate Unobservablen/aShort-term dairy volume growth rateUnobservablen/aValue at point of production1Unobservablen/aUnit pricesObservableReadily obtainableAnimals’ useful lifespanObservableReadily obtainablePercentage of new dairy bulls to be produced internally each year1Unobservablen/aAge profile of bulls1 Unobservablen/aRisk-adjusted discount rate1Unobservablen/aPorcine (non pure line herds)Animals’ useful lifespanObservableReadily obtainableThe proportion of animals that go to slaughterObservableReadily obtainableThe mix of boars and giltsObservableReadily obtainableRisk-adjusted discount rateUnobservablen/aPorcine (pure line herds)Number of future generations attributable to the current herdsObservableReadily obtainableFair value prices achieved on salesObservableOpen market pricesAnimals’ expected useful lifespan and productivityObservableReadily obtainableThe proportion of animals that go to breeding sales1ObservableReadily obtainableRisk-adjusted discount rate1Unobservablen/a1 Key sources of estimation uncertainty.\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021114Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 20215. SEGMENTAL INFORMATIONIFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive and the Board, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The Group’s operating and reporting structure comprises three operating segments: Genus PIC, Genus ABS and Genus Research and Development. These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its segmental information. The principal activities of each segment are as follows: >Genus PIC – our global porcine sales business; >Genus ABS – our global bovine sales business; and >Genus Research and Development – our global spend on research and development.A segmental analysis of revenue, operating profit, depreciation, amortisation, non-current asset additions, segment assets and liabilities and geographical information is provided below. We do not include our adjusting items in the segments, as we believe these do not reflect the underlying performance of the segments. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies, as described in the Financial Statements.Revenue2021£m2020£mGenus PIC315.6298.8Genus ABS250.1237.6Genus Research and Development Porcine product development7.311.7Bovine product development1.33.3Gene editing––Other research and development––8.615.0574.3551.4Adjusted operating profit by segment is set out below and reconciled to the Group’s adjusted operating profit.

REVENUEAccounting policyThe Group recognises revenue from the following sources: >sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products; >royalties; >consulting;  >technical services and advice revenues;  >installation and maintenance of IntelliGen technology; >licensing of IntelliGen technology;  >slaughter animal sales; and >bovine partnership contracts.Revenue is measured based on the consideration the Group expects to be entitled to under a contract with a customer and  excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer. the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary productsRevenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products is recognised when the control of the goods has transferred to the customer or distributor. This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, depending on the terms of sale. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately, or within a short period of time, from the point the customer or distributor controls the goods.RoyaltiesRoyalties are recognised when the performance obligation is met. We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based on key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of the animals born. This amount is confirmed directly to Genus by the customer. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately from the customer, or within a short period of time, once the performance obligation is satisfied.consultingRevenue from consulting represents the amounts we charged for services we provided during the year, including recoverable expenses. We recognise consulting services provided but not yet billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive payment. Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event occurs. technical services and advice revenuesRevenue from technical services and advice revenues represents the amounts we charged for services we provided during the year, including recoverable expenses. We recognise technical services and advice revenues provided but not yet billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive payment. Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event occurs. Technical services and advice revenues are presented in ancillary services in the following table.Installation and maintenance of IntelliGen technologyRevenue from the installation of IntelliGen technology is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the installation and is based on milestones being met. Maintenance is provided as a distinct service to customers and is recognised over the period of the service agreement. These revenues are presented in ancillary services in the following table.licensing of IntelliGen technologyRevenue from the licensing of IntelliGen technology is recognised at a point in time when the licence is granted. In determining the transaction price, any minimum royalties due under the contracts are included in the value apportioned to the grant of the licence, excluding any royalties that arise on units produced in excess of the guaranteed minimums. These additional royalties have been determined to be a usage-based royalty and are recognised as revenue at the point in time that the units are produced. These revenues are presented in ancillary services in the following table.slaughter of animalsRevenue from the slaughter of animals is recognised when control of the goods has transferred to the slaughterhouse, which is generally on the delivery of animals to the slaughterhouse. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately, or within a short  period of time, from the point the slaughterhouse controls the goods.\f117FINANCIAL STATEMENTS6. REVENUE CONTINUEDBovine partnership contractsPartnership contracts include the provision of multiple bovine products and services for a single price. The contract price is allocated to the individual performance obligations based on their standalone selling prices.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMSAccounting policyWe present exceptional items separately, as we believe it helps to improve the understanding of the Group’s underlying performance. In determining whether an item should be presented as exceptional, we consider items which are material either because of their size or their nature, and those which are non-recurring. For an item to be considered as exceptional, it must initially meet at least one of the following criteria: >it is a one-off material item; >it has been directly incurred as the result of either an acquisition, integration or other major restructuring programme;  >it has been previously classified as an exceptional item, and as such consistent accounting treatment is being applied; or >it is unusual in nature, e.g. outside the normal course of business.If an item meets at least one of the criteria, we then exercise judgement as to whether the item should be classified as exceptional. For the tax and cash impact of exceptional items see notes 11 and 32, respectively.Operating (expense)/credit2021  £m2020  £mLitigation and damages(2.5)(16.4)Acquisition and integration(0.3)(2.1)Pension related(2.3)–Other1.8(0.7)(3.3)(19.2) \fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021118Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 20217. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUEDLitigation and damagesLitigation includes legal fees of £2.5m (2020: £5.6m) related to the actions between ABS Global, Inc. and certain affiliates (‘ABS’)  and Inguran, LLC and certain affiliates (aka Sexing Technologies (‘ST’)) and £nil (2020: £10.8m) for damages and costs related to  patent infringement.Material litigation activities during the year ended 30 June 2021In July 2014, ABS launched a legal action against ST in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and initiated anti-trust proceedings which ultimately enabled the launch of ABS’s IntelliGen sexing technology in the US market (‘ABS I’). In June 2017, ST filed proceedings against ABS in the same District Court, where ST alleged that ABS infringed seven patents and asserted trade secret and breach of contract claims (‘ABS II’). The ABS I and ABS II proceedings in the periods before the year ended 30 June 2021 are more fully described in the Notes to the Financial Statements in previous Annual Reports. On 29 January 2020, ST filed a new US complaint against ABS (‘ABS III’). ABS has prepared and filed a response to the ABS III complaint, including a motion to dismiss, on the basis that all these issues were fully resolved in either the ABS I or ABS II litigations. The parties await the court’s decision.On 10 March 2020, the USPTO issued patent 10,583,439 (the ‘’439 patent’), and subsequently ST asked the court for permission to  file a supplemental complaint in ABS III asserting infringement of the ’439 patent. ABS believes that ST’s claim for infringement falls  short and has filed an opposition to ST’s request. On 15 April 2020, ST filed a new complaint (‘ABS IV’), asserting the same claim of infringement of the ’439 patent alleged in its supplemental complaint and then moved to consolidate the ABS IV and ABS III litigation. ABS has opposed this action and has filed a motion for summary dismissal. On 23 June 2020, the USPTO issued patent 10,689,210 (the ‘‘210 patent’), and on 6 July 2020, ST sought a second supplement of ABS III by adding a claim of ’210 patent infringement. ABS has opposed this action. The parties await the court’s decision. On 26 October 2020 and 10 December 2020, ABS filed Inter Partes Reviews (‘IPR’) against the ‘439 and ‘210 patents with the USPTO.  On 4 May 2021, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (‘PTAB’) instituted the ‘439 patent IPR, finding a likelihood of success on all challenged claims. A hearing and decision in the ‘439 patent IPR will be completed in the next 12 months. On 7 June 2021, PTAB declined to institute the ‘210 patent IPR without examining the merits of the case. PTAB’s decision was based on its exercise of its discretion, concluding that the prior art referenced in the IPR was cited during the initial examination, therefore ABS could not demonstrate the examiner made a material error, notwithstanding that the relevant prior art was not addressed by the examiner. ABS has filed a rehearing application. ABS has also sought judgments as a matter of law (‘JMOL’) in relation to the invalidity of all three of the patents considered in ABS II, JMOLs in relation to the non-infringement of two of those patents, and a reduction in damages awarded by the jury. The parties await the court’s decision.Indian Litigation: In September 2019, ST also filed parallel patent infringement proceedings against ABS in India, alleging infringement of the Indian patent 240790 (‘’790 patent’). The ‘790 patent is the equivalent of the US patent 7,311,476 asserted in ABS II. ABS had already sought the revocation of the ‘790 patent in April 2017 before the Indian Patent Office and has now consolidated the revocation petition as a counterclaim in the Indian court proceedings. Progress of these proceedings has been delayed due to the impact of the pandemic. Acquisitions and integrationDuring the year, £0.3m (2020: £2.1m) of expenses were incurred in relation to acquisitions completed during the year.Pension relatedOn 20 November 2020, the High Court ruled that individual transfer payments made since 17 May 1990 would need to be equalised  for the effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’). This judgment followed on from the previous judgment on 26 October 2018, where the High Court ruled that schemes had a legal obligation to pay benefits allowing for GMP equalisation, resulting in an additional liability being recognised. The previous judgment had not considered historic transfer values. Genus’s pension schemes  are also affected by this ruling, resulting in an aggregate past service charge of £2.3m in the period, being £0.9m for the Dalgety Pension Fund (‘DPF’) and £1.4m for the Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’).Other Included within Other is a £2.0m credit resulting from a share forfeiture exercise, in accordance with the Articles of Association. As a three-year liability period ended during the year, the related provision was no longer needed and was therefore released. Included in the prior year was £0.8m of expenses which relate to the costs of entering into our strategic porcine collaboration in China.\f119FINANCIAL STATEMENTS8.

TAXATION AND DEFERRED TAXATIONThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets and liabilities held across the Group, together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of them in the future.Accounting policiesTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. We recognise tax in the Income Statement, unless: >it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity; or >it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination. We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay (or recover), using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit. We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet liability method. We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent that we will probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against. We do not recognise these assets and liabilities if the temporary difference arises from: >our initial recognition of goodwill; or >our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects neither our taxable profit nor our accounting profit.We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures and associates, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset. We charge or credit deferred tax in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.Income tax expense2021  £m2020  £mCurrent tax expenseCurrent period18.313.8Adjustment for prior periods1.3(1.1)Total current tax expense in the Group Income Statement19.612.7Deferred tax expenseOrigination and reversal of temporary differences(10.3)(2.6)Adjustment for prior periods(0.3)0.5Total deferred tax credit in the Group Income Statement(10.6)(2.1)Total income tax expense excluding share of income tax of equity accounted investees9.010.6Share of income tax of equity accounted investees (see note 18)3.02.3Total income tax expense in the Group Income Statement12.012.9Reconciliation of effective tax rate2021  %2021  £m(restated)12020  %(restated)12020 £mProfit before tax55.846.3Add back share of income tax of equity accounted investees3.02.3Profit before tax excluding share of income tax of equity accounted investees58.848.6Income tax at UK corporation tax of 19.0% (2020: 19.0%)19.011.219.09.2Effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions10.56.26.83.3Non-deductible expenses2.01.23.51.7Tax exempt income and incentives(8.7)(5.2)(5.0)(2.4)Change in tax rate(4.4)(2.6)(3.1)(1.5)Movements in recognition of tax losses(1.2)(0.7)3.11.5Change in unrecognised temporary differences2.21.3(0.4)(0.2)Tax over provided in prior periods0.50.3(0.6)(0.3)Change in provisions1.20.71.60.8Tax on undistributed reserves (0.7)(0.4)1.60.8Total income tax expense in the Group Income Statement20.412.026.512.91 See note 2 for details of the prior period restatement.\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021122Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202111. TAXATION AND DEFERRED TAXATION CONTINUEDThe tax rate for the year depends on our mix of profits by country and our ability to recognise deferred tax assets in respect of losses in some of our smaller territories. Tax is calculated using prevailing tax legislation, reliefs and existing interpretations and practice.The Group’s future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by factors such as countries reforming their tax legislation to implement the OECD’s BEPS recommendations and by European Commission initiatives including state aid investigations.In October 2017, the European Commission announced that it would be conducting a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Partial Exemption (‘Finco exemption’) contained within the UK’s controlled foreign company (‘CFC’) legislation. Genus, in common with many other UK companies, has taken advantage of this financing structure to support intra-Group lending to the Group’s subsidiaries in the US. The Commission concluded in April 2019 that the exemption contravened EU law and constituted partial state aid, to the extent that the specific people functions (‘SPFs’) most relevant to managing the financing activities were based in the UK. The UK Government, as well as a number of affected UK taxpayers including Genus, have appealed the EU Commission’s conclusions and court hearings for these appeals/annulment requests are currently pending, with a decision expected in the summer of 2022.Under the EU Commission ruling, the UK Government is required to identify any previous beneficiaries of the CFC Finco reliefs, quantify the associated state aid and recover any identified amounts from UK taxpayers. In March 2021, HMRC issued Genus with a charging notice for £1.2m in respect of its assessment of the amount of unlawful state aid due to be recovered. Genus has paid the assessed amount but has lodged an appeal against this assessment with HMRC, on the basis that the amount charged is not state aid (i.e. the original EU Commission decision is unsound in law) and also on the basis that HMRC’s actual assessment is erroneously based on the view that there are no non-UK SPFs in relation to the relevant CFC structure. Genus has provided £0.4m (2020: £1.0m) in respect of its exposure to the reclaim of previously enjoyed tax benefits under this state aid challenge but will continue to pursue the various avenues of appeal open to it against both the original EU Commission’s decision and against HMRC’s interpretation of that decision, as calculated in the charging notice received.The tax credit attributable to exceptional items is a credit of £1.1m (2020: credit of £4.5m).Income tax recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Changes in Equity2021  £m2020  £mFinancial instruments–0.1Foreign exchange differences on long-term intra-Group currency loans and balances(0.1)–Gain on equity instruments measured at fair value(1.7)–Actuarial movement on retirement benefit obligations(0.3)0.8Foreign exchange differences on translation of biological assets, intangible assets and leases7.7(1.5)5.6(0.6)Income tax recognised directly to the Statement of Changes in EquityShare-based payment expense1.51.11.51.1Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilitiesAt the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses which were available for offset against future profits, with a potential tax benefit of £15.2m (2020: £13.6m). We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £7.3m (2020: £3.9m) of these benefits, as we expect these losses to be offset against future profits of the relevant jurisdictions in the near term. We have not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the remaining £7.9m (2020: £9.7m), due to uncertainty about the availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions. At 30 June 2021, the expiry dates of deferred tax assets in respect of losses available for the carry forward were as follows:Expiring within1–10 years£m11–20 years£mUnlimited£mTotal£mLosses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised0.20.17.07.3Losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised0.2–7.77.90.40.114.715.2In addition, at the balance sheet date, the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of fixed asset timing differences of £3.4m (2020 restated: £2.6m). This unrecognised fixed asset position has arisen as a result of the change in accounting policy for ‘Software as a Service‘ (‘SaaS‘) arrangements as detailed in note 2. These unrecognised fixed asset timing differences have an unlimited expiry date.\f123FINANCIAL STATEMENTS11.

The gross value of losses for which deferred tax assets are not recognised is £25.6m (2020: £33.3m).We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling £2.9m (2020: £2.1m) for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. This is because we can control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilitiesWe have offset deferred tax assets and liabilities, to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.The analysis of deferred tax balances is set out below:2021 £m 2020 £m Deferred tax assets (8.0)(3.7)Deferred tax liabilities53.065.545.061.8The Finance Bill 2021, which was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, introduced a new rate of UK corporation tax of 25% for large companies, with effect from 1 April 2023.

GOODWILLAccounting policiesWhen we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost, excluding transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately, or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are separable.We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. We allocate goodwill to cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), which are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment. IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, rather than of the acquiring entity: >goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation; and >any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities.We therefore express them in the foreign operation’s functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date.\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021126Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202114. GOODWILL CONTINUEDImpairmentWe review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any indication exists, we estimate the asset’s recoverable amount. For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at each balance sheet date. The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, we discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate, which is derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). For some countries we add a premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country. If the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the CGU that the asset belongs to.We recognise an impairment loss in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the unit’s other assets on a pro rata basis.The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows:Genus PIC£mGenus ABS£mTotal£mCostBalance at 1 July 201973.033.3106.3Effect of movements in exchange rates1.1(1.8)(0.7)Balance at 30 June 202074.131.5105.6Business combination (see note 42)3.5–3.5Effect of movements in exchange rates(5.1)(2.5)(7.6)Balance at 30 June 202172.529.0101.5Amortisation and impairment lossesBalance at 1 July 2019, 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021–––Carrying amountsAt 30 June 202172.529.0101.5At 30 June 202074.131.5105.6To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our CGUs, which are in line with our operating segments. These are the lowest level within the Group at which we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. We determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations relate to discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices, cost savings derived from the IntelliGen technologies, and changes in product mix.We have estimated the pre-tax discount rate using the Group’s WACC. We risk-adjusted the discount rate for risks specific to each market, adding between nil and 29% (2020: nil and 24%) to the WACC as appropriate. The pre-tax discount rate of 11% (2020: 11%) we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a post-tax rate of 9.6% (2020: 9.3%). Our estimates of changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market.The annual impairment test is performed on 31 March (2020: 31 May). There have been no additional indicators of impairment identified after this date that would require the impairment test to be reperformed. It is based on cash flows derived from our most recent financial and strategic plans approved by management, over the next five years. A growth rate of 2.5% (2020: 2.5%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period. Short-term profitability and growth rates are based on past experience, current trading conditions and our expectations of future changes in the market.\f127FINANCIAL STATEMENTS14.

Management has concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in any one of the key assumptions that would cause the carrying amounts of goodwill to exceed the value in use of PIC and ABS.15. INTANGIBLE ASSETSOur Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets, including acquired technology, customer relationships, software and our IntelliGen development project. Accounting policiesIdentifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.For ‘Software as a Service‘ (‘SaaS‘) arrangements, we capitalise costs only relating to the configuration and customisation of SaaS arrangements as intangible assets where control of the software exists. Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair values. Their cost is their fair value at the acquisition date.After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately. The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows: >Porcine and bovine genetics technology  20 years >Multiplier contracts    15 years >Brands     10 to 15 years >Customer relationships    10 to 17 years >IntelliGen     10 years >Patents and licences    term of agreement (4 years) >Software     2 to 10 years\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021128Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202115.

BIOLOGICAL ASSETSThe Group applies quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding. We use these techniques to identify and select animals with the genes responsible for superior milk and meat, high health and performance traits. We sell breeding animals, semen and embryos to customers, who use them to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency and milk and meat quality,  for the global dairy and meat supply chain. We recognise that accounting for biological assets is an area which includes key sources of estimation uncertainty. These are outlined in note 4 and sensitivities are provided below. Accounting policiesBiological assets and inventoriesIn bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the Holstein dairy breed. Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and progeny testing of its daughters’ performance. We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers’ demand. Farmers use semen from dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock. They use the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.Our research and development also enables us to produce and select our own genetically superior females, from which we will breed future bulls.We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets. We transfer bull semen to inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2. We state our inventories at the lower  of this deemed cost and net realisable value.Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process. As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed semen production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the production process.  We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost. In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock (the ‘nucleus herd’), to provide genetically superior animals. These genetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-quality products, which yield higher value. So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority of our pig production to  our global multiplier network. We also sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers, for use  in commercial farming. Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: ‘upfront’ and ‘royalty’. Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the animal at the point we transfer it to the customer. Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately identifiable components: its carcass and its genetic potential. We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately the animal’s carcass value, at the point we transfer the pig to the customer. We retain our interest in the pig’s genetic potential and receive royalties for the customer’s use of this genetic potential. The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty contracts, are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. We recognise changes in fair value in the Income Statement, within operating profit for the period. We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals as non-current assets and carry them at fair value. The porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified as current assets. Determination of fair values – biological assetsIAS 41 ‘Agriculture’ requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet. We determine this carrying value according to IAS 41’s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the Income Statement. There are important differences in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.Bovine – we base the fair value of all bulls on the net cash flows we expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current risk-adjusted market-determined rate. The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, the estimated biological value and the marketable life of bulls. The biological value is the estimated value at the point of production. We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory where a third party earns a royalty from semen sales  from a particular bull. Females are valued by reference to market prices and published independent genetic evaluations. The net  cash flows include any expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Porcine – the fair value of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the genetics  of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the animals’ average live weights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable. We base the live weight value and the genetic premium on recent transaction prices we have achieved. The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding animals’ expected life, the percentage of production animals that are saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices.  For our retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales of similar animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element. We then remeasure  the fair value of our retained interest at each reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the animals’ expected life. The assumptions used include any expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account. We do this using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds’ future outputs at current prices. The significant assumptions we make are the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we achieve on sales, the animals’ expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the risk-adjusted discount rate.\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021130Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202116. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS CONTINUEDnon-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where the Group does not retain a contractual interestTo manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers (‘multipliers’) who produce piglets on farms we neither manage nor control. We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium. Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the Group Balance Sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to hold them for the purpose of receiving non-financial items (the offspring), in accordance with our expected purchase requirements. This means the option is outside the scope of IFRS 9. We do not recognise the offspring as biological assets under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.Fair value of biological assetsBovine£m Porcine£mTotal£mNon-current biological assets98.7188.4287.1Current biological assets–40.140.1Balance at 30 June 201998.7228.5327.2Increases due to purchases17.5118.7136.2Decreases attributable to sales–(217.3)(217.3)Decrease due to harvest(24.5)(22.7)(47.2)Changes in fair value less estimated sale costs13.5130.6144.1Effect of movements in exchange rates2.04.96.9Balance at 30 June 2020107.2242.7349.9Non-current biological assets107.2202.9310.1Current biological assets–39.839.8Balance at 30 June 2020107.2242.7349.9Increases due to purchases15.2134.8150.0Decreases attributable to sales–(223.0)(223.0)Decrease due to harvest(24.4)(21.4)(45.8)Business combination (see note 42)–0.30.3Changes in fair value less estimated sale costs3.9118.4122.3Effect of movements in exchange rates(9.9)(24.3)(34.2)Balance at 30 June 202192.0227.5319.5Non-current biological assets92.0187.9279.9Current biological assets–39.639.6Balance at 30 June 202192.0227.5319.5Bovine biological assets include £7.4m (2020: £5.5m) representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties, which are therefore treated as assets held under finance leases.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTWe make significant investments in our property, plant and equipment. All assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.Accounting policies We state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any directly attributable acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, we account for them separately.We charge depreciation to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part of an asset.  The estimated useful lives are as follows: >Freehold buildings 10 to 40 years >Leasehold buildings  over the term of the lease >Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years >Motor vehicles  3 to 5 yearsWe do not depreciate land or assets under construction.Right-of-use assetsRight-of-use assets are measured initially at cost, based on the value of the associated lease liability, adjusted for any payments made before inception, initial direct costs and an estimate of the dismantling, removal and restoration costs required in the terms of the lease. Subsequent to initial recognition, we record an interest charge in respect of the lease liability. The related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the term of the lease or, if shorter, the useful economic life of the leased asset. The lease term shall include the period of an extension option where it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Where the lease contains a purchase option, the asset is written off over the useful life of the asset when it is reasonably certain that the purchase option will be exercised.

EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTEESWe hold interests in several joint ventures and associates where we have significant influence. Accounting policiesJoint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases. When our share of losses exceeds our interest in an associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop recognising further losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on an associate’s behalf.Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures or associates are initially recognised in the Group Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint ventures and associates. Related-party transactions with the Group’s joint ventures and associates primarily comprise the sale of products and services. As each arrangement is a separate legal entity and control rights are substantially equal with the other parties, no significant judgements are required.The Group’s share of profit after tax in its equity accounted investees for the year was £13.1m (2020: £8.9m).The carrying value of the investments is reconciled as follows:2021  £m 2020  £m Balance at 1 July 22.723.6Share of post-tax retained profits of joint ventures and associates13.18.9Additions2.42.2Disposal proceeds–(3.8)Dividends received from Agroceres – PIC Genética de Suínos Ltda (Brazil)(2.5)(2.2)Dividends received from HY-CO Hybridschweine-Cooperations GmbH (Germany)–(0.3)Dividends received from Inner Mongolia Haoxiang Pig Breeding Co.

OTHER INVESTMENTSWe hold a number of unlisted and listed investments, mainly comprising our strategic investment in Caribou Biosciences, Inc. (‘Caribou’)and shares in listed entity National Milk Records plc (‘NMR’). Accounting policiesFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) comprise equity securities which are not held for trading, and which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial recognition to recognise as FVOCI. The Group considers this classification relevant as these are strategic investments.Financial assets at FVOCI are adjusted to the fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date, with any gain or loss being recognised in other comprehensive income and held as part of other reserves. On disposal any gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income and the cumulative gains or losses are transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through income statement, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through income statement are expensed in the Income Statement.Other investments may include equity investments (where the Group does not have control, joint control or significant influence in the investee), short-term deposits with banks and other investments with original maturities of more than three months. Any dividends received are recognised in the Income Statement.Investments carried at fair value2021  £m2020  £mUnlisted equity shares – Caribou Biosciences, Inc.10.43.7Unlisted equity shares – Other2.31.4Listed equity shares – NMR2.01.814.76.9\f137FINANCIAL STATEMENTS19. OTHER INVESTMENTS CONTINUEDWe hold a strategic non-controlling interest in Caribou, which is measured at fair value using the valuation basis of a Level 2 classification. In July 2021, Caribou shares started publicly trading on NASDAQ. Given the proximity of the transaction to the balance sheet date, our holding has been valued at the average price expected to be achieved on listing.NMR ordinary shares were acquired as part of the NMR pension agreement, and are measured at fair value. The valuation basis isLevel 1 classification, where fair value techniques are quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Other unlisted equity investments primarily consist of strategic non-controlling interests in bovine technology companies, which are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is Level 3 classification, where fair value techniques use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value and are not based on observable market data.20. INVENTORIESOur inventory primarily consists of bovine semen, raw materials and ancillary products.Accounting policiesInventory (excluding biological assets’ harvest) is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted average costs and comprises direct materials and, where appropriate, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.For our biological assets accounting policies, see note 16.2021  £m2020  £mBiological assets’ harvest classed as inventories17.820.3Raw materials and consumables2.90.7Goods held for resale16.316.437.037.421.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUEDTrade receivablesThe average credit period our customers take on the sales of goods is 53 days (2020: 53 days). We do not charge interest on receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. The Group always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (‘ECLs’). The ECLs on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default experience of the debtor and an analysis of the debtor’s current financial position, adjusted for factors that are specific to the general economic conditions of the industry and country in which the debtor operates and an assessment of both the current and the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date. The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, such as when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings.The Group recognises ECLs with reference to the following matrix, in accordance with the simplified approach permitted in IFRS 9.  There has been no change in the estimation techniques during the current reporting period. A component of the calculation is the risk premium of the countries in which our customers operate. The risk premiums are updated on each reporting date, to reflect changes  in the global economy.North AmericaLatin AmericaEMEAAsia20211.6%4.6%3.1%12.9%20201.6%6.3%2.6%12.2%The following table shows the movement in lifetime ECLs that has been recognised for trade receivables, in accordance with the simplified approach set out in IFRS 9. 2021  £m2020  £mBalance at the start of the year3.42.6Change in loss allowance due to new trade and other receivables originated net of those derecognised due to settlement3.42.5Amounts written off as uncollectable(0.3)(0.3)Impairment losses reversed(1.4)(1.3)Effect of movements in exchange rates(0.1)(0.1)Balance at the end of the year5.03.4The aging of trade receivables is presented below:Trade receivables Trade receivables  net of impairmentDays past due2021  £m2020  £m2021  £m2020  £mNot yet due 67.865.465.362.90–30 days9.68.79.18.331–90 days 6.55.95.15.591–180 days1.81.51.71.5Over 180 days1.52.21.02.187.283.782.280.3No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables (2020: no more than 5%).The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.Receivables denominated in currencies other than Sterling comprise £35.7m denominated in US Dollars (2020: £34.7m),  £11.8m denominated in Euros (2020: £13.2m) and £37.9m denominated in other currencies (2020: £32.1m).\f139FINANCIAL STATEMENTS22.

The carrying values of these liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.24. CONTRACT BALANCESAccounting policyA contract asset is recognised when the Group’s right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time,  for example the completion of future performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer. In some instances, the Group receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule, as established in the contract, which may not match with the pattern of performance under the contract. Where payment is received ahead of performance a contract liability will be created, and where performance obligations are satisfied ahead of billing, then a contract asset will be recognised. 2021  £m2020  £mContract assets (note 21)7.75.1Current contract liabilities(10.6)(8.2)Non-current contract liabilities(1.4)(3.3)Contract liabilities (note 23)(12.0)(11.5)\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021140Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202124.

The contract assets relate to revenue recognised for performance in advance of scheduled billing and have increased as the Group has provided more services ahead of the agreed payment schedules for certain contracts. The contract liability relates to payments received in advance of performance under contract and varies based on performance under these contracts.The transaction price allocated to partially unsatisfied performance obligations at 30 June 2021 is £3.6m (2020: £6.8m). It is expected that the Group will recognise this revenue over the next four years.25. PROVISIONSA provision is a liability recorded in the Group Balance Sheet, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore estimated. The main provisions we hold relate to litigation damages, legal provisions, customer claims and share forfeiture.Accounting policiesWe recognise a provision in the Balance Sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic benefits.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThis note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the Group’s exposure and sensitivity to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange rate risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage these risks.Financial risk management objectivesThe Group’s corporate treasury function provides services to the business, coordinates our access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Group’s operations, through internal risk reports that analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments. Our use of financial derivatives  is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The Board  of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.Financial riskThe principal financial risks our activities expose us to are the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risks, including: >forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of supplies in foreign currencies; >interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and >forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.Accounting policiesFinancial instrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities in respect of financial instruments are recognised on the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual provisions. Financial liabilities and equity instrumentsFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the Group’s assets after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.put option arrangements over non-controlling interestThe potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for  as financial liabilities.The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge directly to equity. The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling interest, adjacent to non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable. The charge arising is recorded as a financing cost. If the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement immediately, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Income Statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. Derivatives are not offset in the financial statements, unless the Group has both a legally enforceable right and intention to offset. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not due to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.Hedging activitiesThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity risk in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. \fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021142Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202126. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUEDAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationship meets all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:  >there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;  >the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and  >the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. The Group designates the full change in the fair value of a forward contract (i.e. including the forward elements) as the hedging instrument for all of its hedging relationships involving forward contracts. The Group designates only the intrinsic value of option contracts as a hedged item, i.e. excluding the time value of the option. The changes in the fair value of the aligned time value of the option are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve. If the hedged item is transaction related, the time value is reclassified to the Income Statement when the hedged item affects the Income Statement. If the hedged item is time-period related, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is reclassified to the Income Statement on a rational basis, applying straight-line amortisation. Those reclassified amounts are recognised in the Income Statement in the same line as the hedged item. If the hedged item is a non-financial item, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is removed directly from equity and included in the initial carrying amount of the recognised non-financial item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in cost of hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to the Income Statement. cash flow hedgesThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve, and limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item.Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement  in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. This transfer does not affect Other Comprehensive Income. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to the Income Statement.The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to the Income Statement when the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified immediately to the Income Statement.Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed-rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable-rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year. As the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Group performs  a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite directions, in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable  to the change in interest rates. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.net investment hedgesHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contracts relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately  in the Income Statement, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to the Income Statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements. \f143FINANCIAL STATEMENTS26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUEDCapital risk managementThe Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as going concerns, while maximising the return to shareholders by optimising our debt and equity balance. The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 27, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in note 31. Gearing ratioThe Group keeps its capital structure under review and monitors it monthly to ensure the gearing ratio remains below 60%. The Group  is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows:2021  £m(restated)12020  £mDebt (see note 27)151.6143.9Cash and cash equivalents (see note 22)(46.0)(41.3)Net debt (see note 32)105.6102.6Equity1 496.6494.5Net debt to equity ratio21%21%1 See note 2 for details of prior period restatement.Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, including lease obligations as detailed in note 27.Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Parent. Categories of financial instrumentsWe have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs  to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 13. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. We have estimated the fair values of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 13. 2021 Carrying value2020 Carrying valueLevel 1  £mLevel 2  £mLevel 3  £mTotal  £m Level 1  £mLevel 2  £mLevel 3  £mTotal  £m Financial assetsOther investments2.010.42.314.71.8–5.16.9Trade receivables and other debtors, excluding prepayments and accrued income (see note 21)–91.9–91.9–89.1–89.1Cash and cash equivalents–46.0–46.0–41.3–41.3Derivative instruments in non-designated hedge accounting relationships–0.1–0.1–1.2–1.2Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships––––––––2.0148.42.3152.71.8131.65.1138.5Financial liabilitiesTrade and other payables, excluding other taxes and social security (see note 23)–(102.1)–(102.1)–(92.1)–(92.1)Loans and overdrafts (see note 27)–(123.3)–(123.3)–(112.8)–(112.8)Leasing obligations (see note 28)–(28.3)–(28.3)–(31.1)–(31.1)Derivative instruments in non-designated hedge accounting relationships–––––(0.3)–(0.3)Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships–––––(0.2)–(0.2)Put option over non-controlling interest–(6.1)–(6.1)–(6.1)–(6.1)Deferred consideration (see note 38)–(0.4)(1.7)(2.1)–(5.1)(3.6)(8.7)–(260.2)(1.7)(261.9)–(247.7)(3.6)(251.3)We hold a strategic non-controlling interest in Caribou Biosciences, Inc (‘Caribou’), presented above within Other Investments (note 19).

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% or 20% change in foreign currency rates. It includes external loans, as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the loan is denominated in a currency other than the lender or borrower’s currency.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUEDInterest rate risk managementThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as Group entities borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. We manage this risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using interest rate swaps. We regularly review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal hedging strategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.Interest rate sensitivity analysisWe have determined the sensitivity analyses below, based on the Group’s exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and  non-derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0 percentage point increase or decrease is used  when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management and is our assessment of a significant change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 1.0 percentage point higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit would have decreased or increased by £1.2m (2020: decrease/increase by £0.7m). This impact is smaller than would otherwise be the case, due to our fixed-rate hedging.Interest rate swap contractsUnder interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts, calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the  cash flow exposures on the variable-rate debt we hold. We determine the fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date by discounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract. This fair value is disclosed on the following page. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.Cash flow hedgesThe following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding, as at the reporting date:Average contract  fixed interest rateNotional principal amountFair valueOutstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts2021  %2020  %2021  £m2020  £m2021  £m2020  £mUSD interest rate swapsLess than one year–1.22–36.3––One to five years–––––––36.3––GBP interest rate swapsOne to five years1.131.615.025.0–(0.2)The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is three-month LIBOR.  We settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating-rate interest amounts for fixed-rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in the Income Statement, over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect the Income Statement.Since LIBOR will cease as a reference rate after December 2021, the Group has migrated to similar but more robust market standard rates of SONIA as the reference rate for GBP and SOFR as the reference rate for USD. All of the existing interest rate swaps expire before 31 December 2021 and as such there is no assumed impact from LIBOR reform in assessing whether these swaps continue to meet the documented hedging criteria.Commodity hedgesThe Group hedges both feed and slaughter exposures using Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog, corn and soybean meal commodity futures contracts.Average priceNotional principal amountFair valueCommodity hedge2021  US$2020  US$2021  £m2020  £m2021  £m2020  £mOpen commodity contracts as at June 2021Lean hog0.790.587.64.7(0.8)0.9Corn4.783.82(4.3)(2.0)1.0(0.1)Soybean meal382300(3.5)(2.1)(0.1)–(0.2)0.60.10.8\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021146Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202126.

We have a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. We regularly monitor our exposure and the credit ratings of our counterparties, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that the Board reviews and approves annually. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. We carry out ongoing credit evaluation of the financial condition of accounts receivable.Liquidity risk managementThe Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk. We manage this risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.Liquidity and interest risk tablesFor non-derivative financial liabilities, see notes 27, 28 and 38. The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding  trade payables and other creditors which are short term and, as disclosed in note 23, have an average credit period of 27 days  (2020: 21 days).

There is an option to extend the maturity date for a further year before the first and second anniversaries  of the signing date. The first extension has been requested to 24 August 2024 and approved by all participating banks, extending the credit facility by a further 12 months. The facility also includes an uncommitted £100m accordion option, which can be requested on  a maximum of three occasions over the lifetime of the facility to fund the Group’s business development plans.As part of its interest rate strategy, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge floating LIBOR rates. As a result, bank loan and overdrafts include borrowings of £5m fixed at 1.13%, excluding applicable bank margin.28. OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASESA lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future, primarily in relation to property, plant and machinery and motor vehicles.Accounting policiesIn accordance with IFRS 16, we recognise as an expense any payments made in respect of short-term leases (those with a term of less than 12 months) and leases for low-value items on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. For all other leases we recognise a liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available for use, and a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised and depreciated over the term of the lease (see note 17).Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, excluding any payments relating to non-lease components. Future lease payments include fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, and variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. Lease liabilities also take into account amounts payable under residual value guarantees and payments to exercise options, to the extent that it is reasonably certain that such payments will  be made. The payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease or, where that cannot be measured, at an incremental borrowing rate. We remeasure the lease liability (and make a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: >The lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. >The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).  >A lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability  is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.The changes in the lease liabilities are as follows:2021  £m2020  £mBalance at the start of the year31.16.1Recognised on the adoption of IFRS 16–26.6Leases entered into during the year10.49.1Leases terminated early(1.0)–Payments made(12.5)(12.1)Interest0.81.0Effect of movements in exchange rates(0.5)0.4Balance at the end of the year28.331.1At 30 June 2021, the Group is committed to £0.1m (2020: £0.1m) for short-term leases.\f149FINANCIAL STATEMENTS28.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONSThe Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees.  The principal funds are the Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’) and the Dalgety Pension Fund (‘DPF’) in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes. The assets of these funds are held separately from the Group’s assets, are administered by trustees and managed professionally. Accounting policiesDefined contribution pension schemesA number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to the Income Statement as they become payable under the scheme rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the amount we have paid as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. The schemes’ assets are held separately from the Group’s assets.Defined benefit pension schemesThe Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees. These schemes are closed to new members  and to further accrual. We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, in return for their service to date. We discount that benefit to determine its present value and deduct the fair value of the plan’s assets (at bid price). The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities. Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected unit method. We recognise actuarial gains and losses in equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities.Genus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the MPF’s obligations. We account for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will have to pay under our joint and several liability. The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for the scheme’s obligations that we have not accounted for. Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the Income Statement. After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses on the orphan assets and liabilities are recognised directly  in equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.During the year, the DPF defined benefit pension scheme purchased annuities in order to hedge longevity risk for pensioners within the scheme. As permitted by IAS 19, the Group has opted to recognise the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the cost of the policy as an actuarial loss in Other Comprehensive Income.We measure the fair value our qualifying insurance policy assets to be the deemed present value of the related obligation.\fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021150Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202129.

The trustee board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and for the governance of the fund.The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as greater than expected longevity of members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the plans’ liabilities or reduce the value of their assets.UK pensions are regulated by The Pensions Regulator, a non-departmental public body established under the Pensions Act 2004  and sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory framework set by the UK Parliament.  The Pensions Regulator has statutory objectives set out in legislation, which include promoting and improving understanding of the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits and regulating occupational defined benefit and contribution schemes. The Pensions Regulator’s statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website at thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.All defined benefit schemes are registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and are subject to UK legislation and oversight from The Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and valued at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for each scheme. Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time, on a suitably prudent measure.Funding plans are individually agreed with the respective trustees for each of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, taking into account local regulatory requirements.On 20 November 2020, the High Court ruled that individual transfer payments made since 17 May 1990 would need to be equalised  for the effects of GMP. This judgment followed on from the previous judgment on 26 October 2018, where the High Court ruled that schemes had a legal obligation to pay benefits allowing for GMP equalisation, resulting in an additional liability being recognised.  The previous judgment had not considered historic transfer values. Genus’s pension schemes are also affected by this ruling, resulting in an aggregate past service charge of £2.3m in the period, being £0.9m for the DPF and £1.4m for the MPF.the Milk pension Fund (‘MpF’)The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd (the principal employer, now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership in June 2009) and Milk Link Ltd.We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together represent approximately 86% of the MPF (2020: 86%). Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a ‘last man standing scheme’, which means that all participating employers are jointly and severally liable for all of the fund’s liabilities. With effect from 30 June 2013, Genus’s remaining active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2018 and was carried out by qualified actuaries. The valuation has been agreed by the trustees.The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2018 valuation were that: >investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed-interest gilt yields by 1.6% per annum until 31 March 2030, then by 0.5% per annum thereafter; >Consumer Price Index (‘CPI’) price inflation is expected to be 0.9% per annum lower than Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) price inflation; and >pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum and maximum increases.At 31 March 2018, the market value of the fund’s assets was £454m. This represented approximately 95% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were £480m at that date.\f151FINANCIAL STATEMENTS29. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUEDThe deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2018 valuation, was £26m (of which Genus’s notional share was £22m). This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers. Under the trustee prepared schedule of contributions, Genus is required to make deficit repair contributions of £6.0m per annum commencing 1 April 2018, and rising thereafter by 3.4% per annum until 30 September 2021, in addition to funding the scheme’s operating expenses.The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary, based on accurate calculations carried out as at 31 March 2018 and updated to 30 June 2021.Genus has assessed its additional pension liability under IFRIC 14 by reference to this schedule of contributions, resulting in an amount of £42.9m (2020: £22.6m) being recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.Dalgety pension Fund (‘DpF’)The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2018 and was carried out by qualified actuaries. The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2018 valuation were that: >investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed-interest gilt yields by 1.6% per annum until 31 March 2018, then equal the gilt yield per annum thereafter; >CPI price inflation is expected to be 0.7% per annum lower than RPI price inflation; and >pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum and maximum increases.The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2018 was £32.9m. The value of those assets represented approximately 109% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were £30.2m at 31 March 2018. Under the funding agreement, the Company will not have to make deficit repair contributions.The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary, based on accurate calculations carried out as at 31 March 2018 and updated to 30 June 2021. As at 30 June 2021 the DPF, which includes a £20.5m separate reserve held against future unknown liabilities materialising, was in an overall net pension asset position of £8.8m. However, the Company does not have the unilateral right to this surplus and therefore in line with IFRIC 14, the recognition of this asset is restricted.In August 2019, the trustees purchased an additional bulk buy-in annuity policy with Legal and General in respect of the remaining deferred and pensioner members, at a cost of £38m. This reflected a £15m premium over an estimated IAS 19 liability of £23m, reducing the restriction on the recognition of assets.The primary bulk annuity policy was secured with an insurance company in July 1999, which matched the benefit entitlement of almost all of the fund’s current and deferred pension liabilities at that time. The value of the policy and related liabilities at 30 June 2021 was £654m (2020: £691m). We do not have any legal rights to any surplus relating to these bulk annuity policies. national pig Development company pension Fund (‘npD’)The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development Company Limited. The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2021, under the provisions of IAS 19, were £6.3m (2020: £6.1m) and £6.6m (2020: £6.8m), respectively. The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the NPD was at 30 June 2017 and was carried out by qualified actuaries. The valuation has been agreed by the trustees.The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2017 valuation were that: >investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed-interest gilt yields by 1.7% per annum; >CPI price inflation is expected to be 1.0% per annum lower than RPI price inflation; and >pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum and maximum increases.The market value of the available assets at 30 June 2017 was £5.2m. The value of those assets represented approximately 78% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were £6.7m at 30 June 2017. Under the trustee prepared schedule of contributions, Genus is required to make deficit repair contributions of £250,000 per annum commencing 1 July 2017.The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary, based on accurate calculations carried out as at 30 June 2017 and updated to 30 June 2021.other unfunded schemesWhen the Group acquired Sygen International plc in 2005, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous Group’s senior employees and executives. Unfunded defined benefits schemesThe scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amounted to £6.6m (2020: £8.4m), based on IAS 19’s methods and assumptions. This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet. It also operates several unfunded defined benefits which amounted to £1.4m (2020: £0.9m). Interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to £0.2m (2020: £0.2m). The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary, using the principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities as for the defined benefit schemes. \fNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021152Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 202129.

This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group Balance Sheet. Interest on plan liabilities amounted to £nil (2020: £nil).The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 1.90% (2020: 1.65%) and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 6.9% (2020: 6.8%).Aggregated position of defined benefit schemes2021  £m2020  £mPresent value of funded obligations (includes Genus’s 86% share of MPF (2020: 86%))1,097.71,159.5Present value of unfunded obligations 8.99.8Total present value of obligations1,106.61,169.3Fair value of plan assets (includes Genus’s 86% share of MPF (2020: 86%))(1,147.2)(1,182.5)Restricted recognition of asset (DPF)8.88.7Recognition of additional liability (MPF)42.922.6Recognised liability for defined benefit obligations11.118.1Each of the defined benefit schemes manages risks through a variety of methods and strategies, including equity protection, to limit the downside risk of falls in equity markets, as well as inflation and interest rate hedging. By funding its defined benefits schemes, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than anticipated. This could occur for several reasons, for example: >Investment returns on the schemes’ assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar falls in the value of the schemes’ liabilities. >The level of price inflation may be higher than that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes. >Scheme members may live longer than assumed, for example due to advances in healthcare. Members may also exercise (or not exercise) options in a way that leads to increases in the schemes’ liabilities, for example through early retirement or commutation of pension for cash. >Legislative changes could also lead to an increase in the schemes’ liabilities.Aggregated position of defined benefit schemesThe fair value of the total plan assets at the end of the reporting period for each category is as follows:Level 1  £mLevel 2  £mLevel 3  £m2021  £m Level 1  £mLevel 2  £mLevel 3  £m 2020  £m Equities–58.5–58.5–50.6–50.6Diversified growth funds0.298.0–98.20.291.5–91.7Liability driven investments–116.8–116.8–145.4–145.4Gilts and corporate bonds–121.1–121.1–115.5–115.5Cash1.64.1–5.71.67.4–9.0Property3.9–34.438.33.3–33.636.9Direct lending–3.727.431.1–2.814.817.6Bulk annuity policy––677.5677.5––714.6714.6Other––––1.2––1.25.7402.2739.31,147.26.3413.2763.01,182.5Note:Level 1: valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.Level 2: valued using techniques based on information that can be obtained from observable market data.Level 3: valued using techniques incorporating information other than observable market data.\f153FINANCIAL STATEMENTS29.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUEDThe sensitivities assume the funds’ assets remain unchanged. However, in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will also affect the value of the funds’ assets. The funds’ investment strategy is to hold matching assets with values that move in line with the liabilities of the fund, to protect against changes in interest rates and inflation.This sensitivity analysis has been prepared using the same method adopted when adjusting results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTSWe have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and senior management as part of their remuneration. To record the cost of these, a charge is recognised over the vesting period in the Group Income Statement, based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Accounting policiesWe recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. We measure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting period of each option. We use a binomial valuation model to measure the fair value of options and a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the fair value of share awards. We adjust the amount we recognise as an expense, to reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.The Group recognised a total share-based payment expense of £7.7m (2020: £5.8m), including National Insurance contributions of £1.2m (2020: £1.0m).Share awardsThere were 665,522 conditional share awards outstanding at 30 June 2021. These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the 2014 Performance Share Plan on 20 November 2014, 14 September 2015, 14 September 2016, 13 September 2017, 9 October 2018, 11 September 2019, 7 April 2020 and 14 September 2020. In accordance with the plan’s terms, participants have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option awards, which will normally vest after three years, with the proportion of the award vesting depending on growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the plan’s performance conditions are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.During the year ended 30 June 2021: >185,386 awards were granted on 14 September 2020, with an aggregate fair value of £7,139,000. The fair value of services received  in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model. At the date of grant, the fair value of a share awarded was £38.51, based on an expected dividend yield of 0.90%. >6,219 awards in total were granted on 8 September 2020, 5 October 2020, 12 October 2020, 25 February 2021, 13 April 2021 and 19 April 2021, with an aggregate fair value of £287,000. The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

CAPITAL AND OTHER COMMITMENTSAt 30 June 2021, outstanding contracted capital expenditure amounted to £1.2m and related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment (2020: £13.2m). 35. CONTINGENCIES AND BANK GUARANTEESContingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payments is considered more than remote but is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably. Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental.The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 29 include obligations relating to the MPF defined benefit scheme. Genus, together with other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. Genus has accounted for its section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing approximately 86% (2020: 86%) of the MPF. As a  result of the joint and several liability, Genus has a contingent liability for the scheme’s obligations that it has not accounted for.  The total deficit of the MPF from the most recent triennial valuation can be found in note 29.The Group has widespread global operations and is consequently a defendant in many legal, tax and customs proceedings incidental to those operations. In addition, there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business in respect of indemnities, warranties and guarantees. These contingent liabilities are not considered to be unusual in the context of the normal operating activities of the Group. Provisions have been recognised in accordance with the Group accounting policies where required. None  of these claims are expected to result in a material gain or loss to the Group.As described in note 7, the Group is involved in ongoing litigation proceedings and investigations with ST that are at various legal stages. The Group makes a provision for amounts to the extent where an outflow of economic benefit is probable and can be reliably estimated. However, there are specific claims identified in the litigation which the Group considers the outcome of the claim is not probable and will not result in the outflow of economic benefit. The Group’s future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by factors such as countries reforming their tax legislation  to implement the OECD’s BEPS recommendations and by European Commission initiatives including state aid investigations.  Further information can be found in note 11.At 30 June 2021, we had entered into bank guarantees totalling £19.1m (2020: £5.9m).36. DIRECTORS AND KEY MANAGEMENT COMPENSATIONIn accordance with IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel are those having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, directly or indirectly.

DEFERRED CONSIDERATION Accounting policiesWe recognise deferred consideration on the Balance Sheet when a business combination contains a contractual clause that defers  a portion of the purchase price. When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Subsequent contingent consideration fair value remeasurements that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are recognised in the Income Statement.Contingent deferred consideration is measured at fair value and the valuation basis is Level 3 classification, where fair value techniques use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.Contingent deferred consideration £mDeferred consideration £mTotal  £mBalance at 1 July 2019–6.26.2Reclassified from provisions (see note 25)4.5–4.5Payment of consideration (0.6)(1.1)(1.7)Release of unutilised contingent consideration(0.4)–(0.4)Effect of movement in exchange rates0.1–0.1Balance at 30 June 20203.65.18.7Business combination (see note 42)0.8–0.8Payment of consideration(2.0)(4.7)(6.7)Release of unutilised contingent consideration(0.4)–(0.4)Effect of movement in exchange rates(0.3)–(0.3)Balance at 30 June 20211.70.42.1Current1.20.41.6Non-current0.5–0.5Balance at 30 June 20211.70.42.1Current2.84.77.5Non-current0.80.41.2Balance at 30 June 20203.65.18.7The balance at 30 June 2021 relates to the following transactions:Fiscal year of transactionContingent deferred consideration £mDeferred consideration £mTotal  £mDe Novo Genetics LLC2017–0.40.4Hermitage Genetics DAC20170.4–0.4Dairy LLC (n/a Bovisync)20190.4–0.4Progenex S.L.20190.1–0.1Sergal Gestió Ramadera, S.L.

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONSBomaz, Inc. and Bogz Dairy, LLC, are well-recognised breeders in the industry, and are related parties to the Group as these entities are under the control of relatives of Nate Zwald, our ABS Dairy COO.  We transact with Bomaz, Inc. and Bogz Dairy, LLC as part of our bull product development effort, under a variety of contracts and agreements. Payments in 2021 amounted to £0.5m (2020: £1.5m). As at 30 June 2021, the balance owing to these entities was £nil  (2020: £nil). All amounts were settled in cash. These related-party transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions.41. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTSIn August 2021, the first of two available extension options for extending our banking facilities was exercised, extending the maturity date of our banking facilities to 24 August 2024.On 22 July 2021, Caribou Biosciences Inc. completed an initial public offering. As part of this process, our series B preference shares converted to common shares at a ratio of 1.818 to 1, resulting in a shareholding of 963,136 common shares. These shares are listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol CRBU, and after an initial period of restriction, considerably improves the liquidity of our investment.42. BUSINESS COMBINATIONSOn 28 June 2021, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Sergal Gestió Ramadera, S.L. (‘Sergal’), a leading Spanish boar stud operator, to integrate our semen supply chain.The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are as follows: £mBiological assets (note 16)0.3Intangible assets identified – customer relationships (note 15)3.7Property, plant and equipment (note 17)0.2Total identifiable assets4.2Goodwill (note 14)3.5Total consideration7.7Satisfied by:Cash6.9Contingent consideration arrangement0.8Total consideration7.7The goodwill of £3.5m arising from the acquisition consists of the future synergies and market opportunities expected from combining the acquired operations with existing Genus operations. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.The contingent consideration arrangement requires certain sales targets to be achieved. The total that Genus could be required to pay under the contingent consideration agreement will not exceed £0.8m.Acquisition-related costs of £0.1m were recognised within exceptional costs (see note 7).Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the 30 June 2021, the acquired trade did not contribute any revenue or profit to the  Group’s results. Had the transaction occurred on 1 July 2020, the contribution to revenue and profit would have been £3.1m and  £0.3m respectfully.\f167FINANCIAL STATEMENTSPARENT COMPANY BALANCE SHEETAs at 30 June 2021Note2021 £m(restated)12020 £m(restated)12019£mNon-current assetsIntangible assetsC36.54.73.1Property, plant and equipmentC41.11.30.5Investments in subsidiariesC5122.8116.2109.3Other investmentsC62.01.82.6Other receivablesC765.1––Derivative financial assetC15––0.4Deferred tax assetC82.11.4–199.6125.4115.9Current assetsOther receivablesC7379.2444.7443.7Cash and cash equivalents1.31.02.0380.5445.7445.7Current liabilitiesCurrent payablesC9(222.8)(224.1)(216.7)ProvisionsC11(0.3)(2.0)–(223.1)(226.1)(216.7)Net current assets157.4219.6229.0Total assets less current liabilities357.0345.0344.9Non-current liabilitiesNon-current payablesC10(111.1)(105.8)(102.1)ProvisionsC11(0.1)(0.4)(2.0)(111.2)(106.2)(104.1)Net assets245.8238.8240.8EquityCalled up share capitalC166.66.56.5Share premium account179.1179.1179.0Own shares(0.1)(0.1)(0.1)Retained earnings60.253.555.2Hedging reserve–(0.2)0.2Total equity245.8238.8240.81  See C1 for details of the prior period restatement.The Company recognised profit for the year of £19.6m (2020 restated: £11.7m profit).The Financial Statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 8 September 2021.Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors.Stephen Wilson  Alison HenriksenChief Executive  Chief Financial OfficerCompany number: 02972325\f168Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021Called up share capital £mShare premium account £mOwn shares £mRetained earnings £mHedging reserve £mTotal equity £mBalance at 1 July 2019 (previously reported)6.5179.0(0.1)63.40.2249.0Prior period restatement–––(8.2)–(8.2)Balance at 1 July 2019 (restated)6.5179.0(0.1)55.20.2240.8Fair value of movement on cash flow hedges, net of tax ––––(0.4)(0.4)Actuarial gain on retirement benefits obligations–––0.5–0.5Movement on pension asset recognition restriction–––(0.4)–(0.4)Other comprehensive income for the year–––0.1(0.4)(0.3)Total profit for the financial year–––11.7–11.7Total comprehensive income for the financial year–––11.8(0.4)11.4Shares issued–0.1–––0.1Dividends–––(18.3)–(18.3)Share-based payment expense, net of tax–––4.8–4.8Balance at 30 June 2020 (restated)6.5179.1(0.1)53.5(0.2)238.8Fair value of movement on cash flow hedges, net of tax––––0.20.2Actuarial gain on retirement benefits obligations–––2.9–2.9Movement on pension asset recognition restriction–––(2.7)–(2.7)Other comprehensive income for the year–––0.20.20.4Total profit for the financial year–––19.6–19.6Total comprehensive income for the financial year–––19.80.220.0Shares issued0.1––––0.1Dividends paid–––(19.5)–(19.5)Share-based payment expense, net of tax–––6.4–6.4Balance at 30 June 20216.6179.1(0.1)60.2–245.8For information on dividends see note 13, cash flow hedges see note 26 and share-based payment expense see note 30.PARENT COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITYFor the year ended 30 June 2021\f169FINANCIAL STATEMENTSC1. ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIESBasis of preparationThe Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’). FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a ‘qualifying entity’ as defined in the standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements  of the Act and IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, as it applies in the European Union. The Group Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB.The Company Financial Statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the Act. The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as set out in note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc. The accounting policies set out below  and stated in the relevant notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements. The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share-based payments, business combinations, financial instruments, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation  of a cash flow statement, standards issued not yet effective, impairment of assets and related-party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc.As permitted by section 408 of the Act, the Company has not presented its own Income Statement in this Annual Report. The functional currency of the Company is Sterling.Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertaintyPreparing company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet  date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.Management has not identified any critical accounting judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty.Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a wholeThis section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the Financial Statements, the policy has been described in that note.Other income and deferred incomeThe Company has entered into a strategic collaboration with Beijing Capital Agribusiness (‘BCA’) under which BCA will establish and fund a collaboration specific entity (‘BCA Future Bio-Tech’) which will use Genus’s intellectual property and know-how to pursue the PRRSv resistance regulatory and development work in China. Genus will receive consideration after meeting certain milestones in the development programme.Each milestone is considered to be either a separate performance obligation, or a set of groups of separate performance obligations, under this agreement and are unbundled in the contractual arrangement as if they are distinct from one another. We assess each separate performance obligation relating to the milestone payments, and upon completion of those performance obligations recognise the fair value of amounts earned in other income. Some performance obligations, such as the transfer of know-how, are recognised at a point in time whereas others, such as the provision of technical services, are recognised over time.  We recognise any received but unearned consideration as deferred income.We will apply the same accounting policy to any other comparable agreements.Prior period restatementThe Company has changed its accounting policy related to the capitalisation of certain software assets. This change follows the IFRIC Interpretation Committee’s guidance published in April 2021 and relates to the capitalisation of costs of configuring or customising application software under ‘Software as a Service’ (‘SaaS’) arrangements.The Group’s accounting policy has historically been to capitalise costs related to the configuration and customisation of SaaS arrangements as intangible assets in the Balance Sheet. Following the adoption of the above IFRIC agenda guidance, current SaaS arrangements, were identified and assessed to determine if the Group has control of the software. For those arrangement where control does not exist, the Group derecognised the intangible asset previously capitalised.This change in accounting policy led to adjustments amounting to a reduction of £13.3m and £8.1m in the intangible assets recognised in the 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 Balance Sheets respectively, and to a £5.2m and £5.9m increase in operating expenses within administrative expenses, in those respective years. Further detail of the impact of the restatement can be found in note 2 of the Group Financial Statements. NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor the year ended 30 June 2021\f170Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021C1. ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES CONTINUEDPensionsA number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to profit and loss as they become payable under the schemes’ rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the amounts actually paid as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. The schemes’ assets are held separately from those of the Company.Certain former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, details of which are given in note 29 to the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-employer defined benefit schemes, whose assets and liabilities are held independently from the Group but within their sponsored Group company. TaxationWe provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Foreign currenciesWe record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date. We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the  Income Statement.Own sharesThe Company has adopted FRS 101, which requires us to recognise the assets and liabilities associated with the Company’s investment in its own shares in the Company’s Financial Statements, where there is de facto control of the assets and liabilities.The Company’s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.Employee share schemesThe Company’s Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of share awards,  which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three-year period.We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares’ fair value at the award date. At the end of each financial reporting period, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three years and record an appropriate charge in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves. Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.Share-based paymentsWe have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with subsidiary undertakings under FRS 101, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings under an equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for these rights. Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary’s financial statements as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an equal amount.Derivative financial instruments and hedgingOur activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.We use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented through a medium-term US Dollar cross-currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiaries. Forward foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its Balance Sheet.Our use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group’s policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The notes to the Group Financial Statements include information about the Group’s financial risks and their management, and its use of financial instruments and their impact on the Group’s risk profile, performance and financial condition.The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021\f171FINANCIAL STATEMENTSC1. ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES CONTINUEDCash flow hedgesThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve, and limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item.Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement  in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. This transfer does not affect Other Comprehensive Income. Furthermore, if the Company expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to the Income Statement.The Company discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to the Income Statement when the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified immediately to the Income Statement.Under interest rate swap contracts, the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Company to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed-rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable-rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year. As the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Company performs  a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite directions, in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Company’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change in interest rates. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.C2.

INTANGIBLE ASSETSAccounting policiesPatents, licences and software are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period is determined by reference to expected useful life, which is reviewed at least annually. Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.See note 15 for useful economic life.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTAccounting policiesWe state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any incidental acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any provision for impairment. We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis, to write the assets down to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as follows: >Leasehold improvements  period of lease >Leased buildings  period of lease >Equipment   3 to 10 yearsWe review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021\f173FINANCIAL STATEMENTSC4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUEDRight-of-use assetsRight-of-use assets are measured initially at cost based on the value of the associated lease liability, adjusted for any payments  made before inception, initial direct costs and an estimate of the dismantling, removal and restoration costs required in the terms of the lease. Subsequent to initial recognition, we record an interest charge in respect of the lease liability. The related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the term of the lease or, if shorter, the useful economic life (‘UEL’) of the leased asset. The lease term shall include the period of an extension option where it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Where the lease contains a purchase option, the asset is written-off over the useful life of the asset when it is reasonably certain that the purchase option will be exercised.

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIESAccounting policiesShares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, then we estimate the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, it is considered to be impaired and we write  it down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.Shares in subsidiary undertakings £mCostBalance at 1 July 2020309.4Additions6.6Balance at 30 June 2021316.0Provision for impairmentBalance at 1 July 2020193.2Provided during the year –Balance at 30 June 2021193.2Carrying amounts At 30 June 2021122.8At 30 June 2020116.2Additions relate to increasing our investment in ABS Pecplan Ltda and Genus Investment Limited.The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and the carrying value of its investments, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. As at 30 June 2021, the net investment in five of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings exceeded the Company’s share of the net assets. Each of these subsidiaries are denominated in Latin American currencies, all of which have seen significant weakening against Sterling during the year ended 30 June 2021. For each of these undertakings, the recoverable value has been estimated using the Board-approved Strategic Plan. There were no indicators of impairment for the Company’s other subsidiary undertakings.The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected  trading performance.\f174Genus plc / AnnuAl RepoRt 2021C5. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES CONTINUEDManagement estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Group. The pre-tax discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’), which has been calculated using the capital asset pricing model, the inputs of which include a country risk-free rate, equity risk premium, Group size premium and a risk adjustment (beta). Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2020: 2.5%).As a result of this analysis, the Company has not recognised any additional impairment charge during the year.Principal subsidiary undertakingsThe Company’s principal subsidiaries and their main activities are given in note 37 to the Group Financial Statements. C6. OTHER INVESTMENTSAccounting policiesListed equity investments are stated at fair value. 2021 £m2020 £mListed investment – NMR2.01.8NMR ordinary shares were acquired as part of the NMR pension agreement, and are measured at fair value. The valuation basis is  Level 1 classification, where fair value techniques are quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.C7.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. There are impaired receivable balances of £nil (2020: £nil) as the Company does not expect any credit losses on amounts owed by Group undertakings, due to the centralised management of these balances. Of the amounts owed by Group undertakings, £329.1m (2020: £324.5m) is interest-bearing and any interest charged is at current market rates.C8. DEFERRED TAXATIONAccounting policiesWe recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date. We only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits from which we can deduct the future reversal of the underlying timing differences. Timing differences are differences arising between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements, and which are capable of reversing in one or more subsequent periods.We only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable. We measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which we expect the timing differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 2021 £m2020 £mDeferred tax asset due within one year2.10.6Deferred tax asset due after more than one year2.11.44.22.0NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 30 June 2021\f175FINANCIAL STATEMENTSC8.

LOANS AND BORROWINGSAccounting policiesWe initially state debt at the amount of the net proceeds, after deducting issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.We charge the finance costs of debt to the profit and loss account over the debt term, at a constant rate on the carrying value of the debt to which they relate.2021 £m2020 £mLoans and borrowings comprise amounts falling due:In one year or less or on demand13.89.5In more than one year but not more than two years–103.8In more than two years but not more than five years109.9–123.7113.3Less: unamortised issue costs(1.3)(0.3)122.4113.0Amounts falling due within one year(13.0)(9.2)Amounts falling due after more than one year109.4103.8At the balance sheet date, the Company’s credit facilities comprised a £150m multi-currency revolving credit facility (‘RCF’), a USD125 million RCF and a USD20 million bond and guarantee facility. The original term of the facility was for three years, with two years remaining at the balance sheet date. There is an option to extend the maturity date by a further year before the first and second anniversaries of the signing date. The first extension has been requested to 24 August 2024 and approved by all participating banks, increasing the credit facility term by a further 12 months. The facility also includes an uncommitted £100m accordion option, which can be requested on a maximum of three occasions over the lifetime of the facility to fund the Group’s business development plans.As part of its interest rate strategy, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge floating LIBOR rates. As a result, bank loan and overdrafts include borrowings of £5m fixed at 1.133%, excluding applicable bank margin.

C13. OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASESA lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future, primarily in relation to property, plant and machinery and motor vehicles.Accounting policiesIn accordance with IFRS 16, we recognise as an expense any payments made in respect of short-term leases (those with a term of less than 12 months) and for low-value items on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. For all other leases we recognise a liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available for use, and a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised and depreciated over the term of the lease (see note C4).Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, excluding any payments relating to non-lease components. Future lease payments include fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, and variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. Lease liabilities also take into account amounts payable under residual value guarantees and payments to exercise options, to the extent that it is reasonably certain that such payments will be made. The payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease or, where that cannot be measured, at an incrementalborrowing rate. We remeasure the lease liability (and make a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: >The lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. >The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).  >A lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability  is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The Company did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDFor the year ended 30 June 2021\f177FINANCIAL STATEMENTSC13.

CAPITAL AND OTHER COMMITMENTSAt 30 June 2021, outstanding contracted capital expenditure amounted to £nil (2020: £nil). C19. PENSIONS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIESThe NMR pension assigned to Genus plc under the Flexible Apportionment Agreement, recorded an actuarial gain of £2.9m, which has increased the asset restriction made in previous years. As the Company does not have unilateral right to this surplus, as required in accordance with IFRIC 14 it is restricted to £nil. For additional information on the MPF pension scheme, of which NMR was one of the participating employers, please see note 29. The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 29 to the Group Financial Statements include obligations relating to the MPF defined benefit scheme. Genus, together with other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. Genus has accounted for its section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing approximately 86% (2020: 86%) of the MPF. As a result of the joint and several liability, Genus has a contingent liability for the scheme’s obligations that it has not accounted for. The total deficit of the MPF scheme from the most recent triennial valuation can be found in note 29.Certain UK subsidiaries, which are detailed in note 37 to the Group Financial Statements, will take advantage of the audit exemption set out within section 479A of the Companies Act 2006 for the year ended 30 June 2021. The Company has given a statutory guarantee over all of the liabilities held by those UK subsidiaries for the year ended 30 June 2021. The Company has assessed the probability of loss under the guarantee as remote.At 30 June 2021, the Company had entered into bank guarantees totalling £13.9m (2020: £nil).C20.

Allows the comparison of underlying financial performance by excluding the impacts of exceptional items and is a performance indicator against which short-term and long-term incentive outcomes for our senior executives are measured:  >net IAS 41 valuation movements on biological assets – these movements can be materially volatile and do not directly correlate to the underlying trading performance in the period. Furthermore, the movement is non-cash related and many assumptions used in the valuation model are based on projections rather than current trading; >amortisation of acquired intangible assets – excluding this improves the comparability between acquired and organically grown operations, as the latter cannot recognise internally generated intangible assets. Adjusting for amortisation provides a more consistent basis for comparison between the two; >share-based payments – this expense is considered to be relatively volatile and not fully reflective of the current period trading, as the performance criteria are based on EPS performance over a three-year period and include estimates of future performance; and >exceptional items – these are items which due to either their size or their nature are excluded, to improve the understanding of the Group’s underlying performance.   >This measure is presented only this year to demonstrate the impact of our change in accounting policy, and will not be presented in future periods. We present this measure to allow comparability of financial performance with the expectations of the year, which were based on our pre-existing accounting policy.ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES GLOSSARYThe Group tracks a number of APMs in managing its business, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS.The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business. These APMs are consistent with how the business performance is planned and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and GELT. Some of these APMs are also used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets.These APMs should be viewed as supplemental to, but not as a substitute for, measures presented in the consolidated financial information relating to the Group, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Group believes that these APMs are useful indicators of its performance. However, they may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies, due to differences in the way they are calculated. The key APMs that the Group uses include:\f181ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONAlternative Performance MeasuresCalculation methodology and closest equivalent IFRS measure  (where applicable)Reasons why we believe the  APMs are usefulAdjusted effective tax rateTotal income tax charge for the Group excluding the tax impact of adjusting items, divided by the adjusted operating profit.

See calculation on page 184.The Board dividend policy targets the adjusted earning cover to be between 2.5–3 times.Adjusted EBITDA – calculated in accordance with the definitions used in our financing facilitiesThis is adjusted operating profit, adding back cash received from our JVs, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of the historical cost of biological assets, operational amortisation (i.e. excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles) and deducting the amount attributable to minority interest.Closest equivalent IFRS measure: Operating profit1 See reconciliation on page 184.This APM is presented because it is used in calculating our ratio of net debt to EBITDA and our interest cover, which we report to our banks to ensure compliance with our bank covenants.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating profit (including JVs) divided by revenue.Allows for the comparability of underlying financial performance by excluding the impacts of exceptional items.Adjusted operating margin (exc JVs)Adjusted operating profit divided by revenue.Constant currency basisThe Group reports certain financial measures, on both a reported and constant currency basis and retranslates the current year’s results at the average actual exchange rates used in the previous financial year.The Group’s business operates in multiple countries worldwide and its trading results are translated back into the Group’s functional currency of Sterling. This measure eliminates the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when comparing year-on-year reported results. Balance Sheet measuresNet debtNet debt is gross debt, made up of unsecured bank loans and overdrafts and obligations under finance leases, with a deduction for cash and cash equivalents.  See reconciliation on page 185. This allows the Group to monitor its levels of debt.Net debt – calculated in accordance with the definitions used in our financing facilitiesNet debt excluding the impact of adopting IFRS 16 and adding back guarantees and deferred purchase arrangements.

This APM is used to understand our ability to meet our interest payments and is also a key metric that we report to our banks to ensure compliance with our bank covenants.Ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDAThe ratio of net debt, calculated in accordance with the definitions used in our financing facilities, is gross debt, made up of unsecured bank loans and overdrafts and obligations under finance leases, with a deduction for cash and cash equivalents and adding back amounts related to guarantees and deferred purchase arrangements, to adjusted EBITDA.Closest equivalent IFRS components for the ratio: The equivalent IFRS components are gross debt, cash and cash equivalents and operating profit   See calculation on page 186. This APM is used as a measurement of our leverage and is also a key metric that we report to our banks to ensure compliance with our bank covenants.Return on adjusted invested capitalThe Group’s return on adjusted invested capital is measured on the basis of adjusted operating profit including JVs after tax, which is operating profit with the pre-tax share of profits from JVs and associates, net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense and exceptional items added back, net of amounts attributable to non-controlling interest and tax. The adjusted operating profit including JVs after tax is divided by adjusted invested capital, which is the equity attributable to owners of the Company adding back net debt, pension liability net of related deferred tax and deducting biological assets (less historical cost) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax.Closest equivalent IFRS components for the ratio: Return on invested capital See calculation and reconciliation on page 186 and 187.This APM is used to measure our ability to efficiently invest our capital and gives us a sense of how well we are using our resources to generate returns. 1 Operating profit is not defined per IFRS.
